It refers to the practices, processes, and tools used by organizations to effectively deliver and manage technology services to support their business operations. In the context of ServiceNow, ITSM includes modules such as Incident Management, Problem Management, Change Management, and Service Catalog to help organizations automate and improve their IT service delivery and support functions.",0,0.25503355704697983,0.3087248322147651,0.5555555555555556
2025-07-03T10:19:23.877274,3b_model_test_mistral7B,Explain CMDB relationships.,"A Configuration Management Database (CMDB) is a system of record for managing configurations in an IT infrastructure. In the context of ServiceNow, the CMDB can be extended using advanced data processing techniques such as Data Fabric and RAPID-RB to handle various data structures and formats. The relationships in a CMDB can be thought of as a knowledge graph, where the connections between different elements represent the relationships between them. For instance, an alert in ITOM can be matched with information from the CMDB, such as previous incidents and workflows, to suggest the best next steps for an operator. Even if an organization doesn't have a fully developed CMDB, this approach can still be effective, as it is decoupled from having a perfect CMDB. In the future, specialized agents could be employed to find the most relevant knowledge base articles or external sources of industry knowledge to provide insights for resolving issues.",0,0.11475409836065574,0.09836065573770492,0.24503311258278146
2025-07-03T10:22:35.276911,3b_model_test_mistral7B,How does Incident Management work?,"In IT Service Management (ITSM), Incident Management refers to a process aimed at restoring normal operations as soon as possible by minimizing the negative effect on business operations and end-users. The process begins with recognizing a change in the IT infrastructure or services, which triggers a specific use case. Each use case consists of multiple agents designed to perform specific tasks. For instance, the Cost Analysis Agent retrieves portfolio cost information, Rationalization Agent identifies potential candidates for resolution, and Action Agent creates demand records. These agents leverage a simple prompt language to understand and prioritize issues based on their impact and severity. By enabling integration with various monitoring tools, ITOM acts as a central hub for managing incidents across complex hybrid cloud environments, allowing organizations to transition from a reactive incident management culture to a proactive, predictive approach.",0,0.15517241379310345,0.15517241379310345,0.2753623188405797
