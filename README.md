# Project-Business-Case-Building-a-Multimodal-AI-ChatBot-for-YouTube-Video-QA
  The goal of this final project is to develop a RAG system or AI bot that combines the power of text and audio processing to answer questions about YouTube videos. The bot will utilize natural language processing (NLP) techniques and speech recognition to analyze both textual and audio input, extract relevant information from YouTube videos, and provide accurate answers to user queries.

# Key Objectives
* Develop a text-based question answering (QA) model using pre-trained language models. 
* Integrate speech recognition capabilities to convert audio/video input questions into text transcripts.
* Build a conversational interface for users to interact with the bot via text or voice input.
* Retrieve, analyze, and store into a vector database (pinecone, FAISS) YouTube video content to generate answers to user questions.
* Test and evaluate the bot's performance in accurately answering questions about YouTube videos.
