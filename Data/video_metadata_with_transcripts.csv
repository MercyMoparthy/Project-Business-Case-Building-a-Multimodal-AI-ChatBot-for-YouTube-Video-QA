In this video, I’ll demonstrate how to build an AI Agent in ServiceNow using the Now Assist Skill Kit (NASK) to provide instant answers about your Portfol",738.0,20250221,1063.0,," Hey folks, how you doing Chris Thanky here? And I'd like to welcome you to this session where I plan to show you the greatest feature I've ever implemented in my entire life. It only took me a couple hours. I'm going to show it to you in probably about 10 minutes. And by the end of it, you can implement it yourself because it is actually incredibly easy to do. Now that we're in this new world of AI agents and LLM in using our low-code, no-code flow designer. So I'll go ahead and we'll start by showing you the demo of just what it is. And you'll get to see why I think it is so incredible and cool. So what we're looking at right now is a portfolio record. In service now, we have project management. We're calling it service portfolio management as well. But you have this idea of these portfolios. Then underneath these portfolios, you're going to have things like demands and projects and issues. And in those projects, you're going to have status report. So it's just this ton and ton of info. And a customer comment they had said, well, what could we do? Could you do something where my project manager comes in on a Monday, and we wanted to know what they need to pay attention to? And we put that in place. And that's this portfolio we can review. But then I was thinking about it. And it really wasn't that much of a step to just make it so that we could ask it anything and get any answer out of it. So in this example, I've added two new fields to this form. You could do this in any way. You want to. I just like things easy. So I added a question and an answer field in the form. So what happens is when I type a question in here, and then I hit my portfolio answers button, it sends all the information, not all the information. It sends key information from the projects, the project status reports, any issues that have happened. And it sends all of those to the LLM. And then I can basically ask it any question. It sort of turns it all into a gigantic retrieval augmented generation system. So let's see what that would look like in practice. So now I gave that example that I mentioned where the customer wants to know, what should I pay attention to when I come in next week. And what it's doing again is it's grabbing all the information. It's sending it to the LLM. The LLM is processing and aggregating it, using the context that we provided. And it's gone ahead and now it's unright. So it's kind of given us information on each project, it's helped us understand where to direct our attention. And can you imagine if you had to go down into each of these projects and review all the status reports and pull all this information out? It would just be, it would be crazy, right? It would take you forever. But here we've done it in an instant. Now in this example, I can see that our evaluation tools has encountered some licensing issues. Okay, well I'm kind of curious what's going on with those. So maybe I'll ask it more. So what's up with the licensing issues on the eBail tools project? Conversationally, even with some misspellings, it's sending that information, it's interpreting it, it's aggregating it, and now it's pulled back. Because again, it knows what's in the status reports, right? So it's knows what's in everything. And we can pull this information out and I can see, ah, it's been escalated over to Beth, in legal. Oh, fantastic. But you know what, I wonder, are we getting kind of dependent on legal? I wonder how often are we having to escalate to legal? How often are we doing it? Imagine you going to your analytics, your reporting person and asking him this question and asking him to extract it. Here we just click a button and instantly we find out that actually that's the only time we've had to do it. So that's good. We've had some licensing issues, but really that's the only time we've had to escalate to legal. So that's fantastic. But these are just some examples of questions. You can ask it anything you want about it. Should we consider consolidating any projects? I don't, should we? Are there some projects maybe that are behind or low ROI that we should consider consolidating? Now I'm not going to trust the LLM to answer this. I'm not going to put an auto button and have the LLM start doing this, but it tells us where to look. It tells us areas where we can have some focus. And you can see here we've got some, now this is all demo data, right? So we've got some projects with no potential return, other ones that maybe consolidated to the project managers. It does still stay down here because our LLM is looking out for you, right? You definitely need to go and look at this yourself, but now you know where to look. And I can even put in something like, you know, list every project project, the project manager, manager and the plan start date in JSON format. So not only can I get information, can it help me understand why I need to look, and it act as my sort of de facto reporting tool, now I can even have it for that stuff for me. So it can help me to extract that data in ways that might be beneficial to me. So amazing feature. And again, it only took me a couple hours to implement. And so let's look at how we do that. Now what I mentioned is that we have this portfolio record and it's got projects in it and it's got all these different things. So what we need to do is we need to bring back information and data from these to give it to the LLM. So if you think about it in your mind, we need to sort of create a big variable where we're just gonna put all this data so that we can give it over the LLM and the LLM can do its processing. Now if I come down here and I look at one of these individual projects, you're gonna wanna, you're gonna wanna sit down in your data, you're gonna wanna look at your data, you're gonna wanna look at what fields are you using, what fields are you not using, what fields are you using inconsistently. You know, when you're looking at your data, you might not be happy, no one's happy with their data. There's always something missing, there's never anything great. What you're really looking for fields that are used consistently and that, especially or fields that have free text to be entered. So something like the business case, that's a great field of process. Definitely if you're putting in financials, you wanna try to bring those in so you could ask questions about financials. But basically you wanna get an understanding of what are the fields that are relevant on the project that you would wanna ask these questions about. And then you create a flow. This is a subflow, no coding is required. Basically what you do is you start with your inputs, right? And our input, think about it, we're at that portfolio, so our input is gonna be that portfolio. That's the first input and then our output is gonna be this big gigantic string that I was talking about. So once we have our inputs and outputs, you then go into a lookup records, plural, not singular, lookup records. So you look up your project records and you look those up where the portfolio is that input variable, so you got initial input variable. I just dragged that over there, that became my input. So now it's only gonna find me projects related to that portfolio. And then I order them by plan start date. Then we need to do a flow action where we go through each record. So we say for each item in our lookup records, we're gonna set a flow variable. And this is where all the magic happens, right? So this is where we've got our flow variable that we create. So you come over here and you go to flow variables and you're gonna wanna create a flow variable. In my case, I called it aggregated response. And again, it's a string. We set it to the output at the end, but right now it's just a flow variable. And then we're gonna set that flow variable. So as it goes through each project, it's gonna grab the name of the project manager, it's gonna grab the status, state, business case, all of these relevant fields. And again, you can put more fields in. The one thing you wanna do, you wanna have your flow variable at the top. So as it cycles through each, it continues to concatmate or sort of cycle after the next one so that you get all your data. And then in the end, what you have is this gigantic string of data. And then you assign that to your output. So our output is in our aggregated response. So again, we're going through the projects. We're pulling out relevant data fields. We're writing those data fields into a string and then we're returning that string as the output. So where are we gonna use the output? You might ask, well, that is over in our skill kit skill. So here is the portfolio answer skill kit. This is where all the magic happens. Now I have a couple inputs. You can see I've got the question as an input, my field. And then I've also got the portfolio record itself. So I've got two different inputs. Inputs are when you know the values ahead of time. Tools are when you need to bring in the value, when you need to pull it in. So you can see here I've got my get issues portfolio. What we were just looking at, get project for portfolio. And I also have get status reports for portfolio. I could have combined these into one. I broke them up because, you know, it seemed like a thing to do at the time. But I could have combined them into one. But you can see here it's going for our get portfolio for, get project for portfolio. And my input value here is my sysid. So that ties it all together when this runs. It's gonna take that sysid from that original portfolio record. And it's gonna find the correct values in the information we want. Now over here is my prompt. And I use the prompt assistance to write that prompt. And then I just put in the different pieces. So you're basically answering questions. Here's the question. Then I have the name of the portfolio. Then I put in here the project records, here are the associated status reports. And then here are the different potential issues. And then I give it the instructions, you know, review the information. And that's it then. Pretty much you're good to go. Once you activate it, oh, sorry, there is one step. You need to create the deployment UI action. So when you come over here to the UI action, you're gonna do something just a little bit different. Because we need our question as our input. And then we need to write our value back to the answer. So over here in our portfolio answers, you can see over here is where I say the question is the current value of the new question field. So I'm telling you what these different input values are by setting it off of the current portfolio record where we input that question onto the screen. Then down here, we're writing our response. But you can see I've got it going into the answer field. So it sends the query to the LLM, it gets the information back, writes it to the answer and then it updates the ticket. And that's it. Once you've finished publishing the skill, you do need to go over to the now assist admin section and activate it from there. So don't forget that very important step. You go over here to our now assist admin. I think it's under experiences. Oh no, it'll show up under features. Other unless you put something else. Here you would just select it and then you just walk through the activation process. It's really easy, you just click to things, it then sets it active. And this will change your UI action to active as well. So you don't need to change the UI action. This will go ahead and do it when you activate it. So good luck. Hopefully it'll be as straightforward for you as it was for me. If you have any questions, please feel free to post or reach out and good luck. Thanks, everybody."

Specifically, what the heck it even is, how it's being used on service now and frankly why you should care a lot as a developer in 2025. Welcome to Breakpoint, the service now developer podcast. Hello service now admins builders developers and curious individuals that I say with the utmost love and respect. Welcome to or welcome back to the Breakpoint podcast, the service now developer podcasts, where we bring you all the latest tools, tips and trade craft to accelerate your developer career. My name is Laura McMahon and happy new year. Hopefully it's not too late to say that quite quite yet. I'm very excited to be here. I hope everyone is having a awesome start to their 2025 and I figure you know, we might as well do I guess what appears to be the quarterly Solo Lauren episode of the podcast. My 2025 so far has been off to a ridiculously roller coaster start, not gonna lie. We started off really high, going on the awesome cruise, all my closest girlfriends. That was amazing. Head a little bit of a peek when I got some really nasty flu followed by bronchitis. But you know what we're bringing back up because of high estate, just one national championship. So what more could I ask for as a Columbus native work wise. We've also had a tremendous amount of progress already. If you want to hear a little bit of how the sausage is made. We've already started kicking off all the internal production regimes for knowledge 25. It's hard to believe it. That knowledge is approximately 70 ish work days away. So it leaves us what seems to be a large amount of time, but it'd be quickly, quickly absolved by all the work that has to be done. In fact, one thing that I thought would be kind of fun to do this year was kind of micro blog the experience of putting on something like CreatorCon. I figured, you know, maybe people would want to join in. So if you're on LinkedIn, I want to pass you along to the hashtag no25 behind the scenes. I'll link it in the comments down below and things like that and in the production notes. But hey, I'll be posting some micro blog updates of what it's like to put on knowledge. And if you two are creating things for knowledge, whether that's labs or sessions, I would love to see your experience as well. In fact, it could probably help enable a lot of others that maybe have not participated in the knowledge experience before, but might be eyeing it for knowledge 26. On top of this, our team is putting out our first of two tech now webinars next week, where literally one week away, I delayed this episode of breakpoint. So it was exactly one week away from tech now, Yoko Hama. If you have not heard of tech now before, that is the webinar completely dedicated to debuting the newest admin and developer features of the new release. We don't cover everything. We don't cover ITSM and HR and security. That would take hours. It's a 60 minute webinar. But every release we do this, my entire team is involved. Kristi Miriam, Earl Duke, Prana of Bugha. And now Travis Tulson as well. So as a team of five working on the production of tech now as we speak, we have entered into the final week of rehearsals and we have a very exciting show for you. So please register for tech now if you haven't already. Again, I will put the link down below as well as in the show notes. If you are listening to this on Spotify, Apple podcasts, etc. Now, obviously those are just a couple of highlights from my year. But before we dive into the topics, I want to, you know, bring the mood down slightly and just say that my heart is extended to all those currently undergoing the terrible wildfires in the LA area. Obviously that has been horrific to see as a third person perspective here in Texas. So I cannot imagine going through it in real life. My heart goes out to all of you. I know what a huge developer community that we have in California in general. So please, I will also be providing links to donate to help relief from the wildfires in the links down below. And also in these show notes, if you are listening to this and auditory fashion. Now let's bring the move back up a little bit. Let's get things rolling because we have a very exciting topic for today. Now in honor of my solo episode for the quarter, I guess, let's dive straight in today's topic. And it's a topic that is definitely ringing in the ears of anyone currently in tech in this service now ecosystem, especially anyone that is currently, I don't know, watching any form of media in the last four to six weeks. And that is a Genetic AI. If you've tuned into anything on TV, hopefully, like I said, watching the Ohio State Buckais win the National Championship, you've seen Edras Elba talking about a Genetic AI and our new slew of commercials that have come out for service now. Last week, you might have also seen that service now as a company has moved to acquire another company called QIn and in the release information for that headline, it also included the statement of the purpose for doing so was to accelerate our Agenetic AI roadmap. If you've been on LinkedIn, you've definitely been lambasted with post after post after post of Mr. Handsome Bill McDermott's head over the advertisement for the Agenetic AI live event that is happening also next week on January 29, where specific tools are going to be debuted to the public as they are included in Yoko Hama and going forward. And all that is to say that in the seven plus years I've worked at service now, I have never, never seen a push like this for a specific trend or product before. So it begs to be asked, what is a Genetic AI? So let's talk about it and why you should care as a developer in the year 2025. I think one of the easiest ways to start communicating what something is and maybe contrasting against what it is not for starters, Agenetic AI is different from the heavily popularized generative AI. If you're going off of metaphors, it would be very wise for you to compare the element of generative AI to polling a crowd, right? Now granted that crowd is the size of probably the entire population of Earth and could react in a way that no human being ever could, but it is pretty much the same. You are asking a question to some sort of trained entity that represents an entire ecosystem of information and it is polling all that together to give you its best attempt at an answer. If you're looking for things in media that compared to this, pretty much any show where the protagonist is saying, computer, what is the that is a example of generative AI? For one, it's reactive. These computers or these algorithms or these AIs are not necessarily going off on their own. They are responding to a specific question or to a specific prompt. They are also extremely dependent on having as large and as informed of a quote unquote crowd as possible. The more data that generative AI is trained on, the more comprehensive and accurate answer that it can provide. If you're using one of the artistic rendering AIs, for example, that had only been trained on Pablo Picasso's work, asking it to create a picture of a rabbit might give you unexpected results. You would want to train on the entire work of art at the Louvre and the modern art, EZM and historical artwork, et cetera. Agenetic AI, well obviously also AI is different than this. If the media comparison for generative AIs to Batman asking his computer to find data, the Agenetic AI comparison would be like the AI from the movie Her with Ockin Phoenix or the AI in the episodes revolving around cookies in Black Mirror. Unfortunately, all the examples of a Genetic AI in media are not the nicest. So please don't let that cloud your judgment, but that's oftentimes how it is used in sci-fi. The first stark difference is a Genetic AI is proactive, not reactive. It not only can anticipate what work or what things need to be automated, but can also improve the process as it acts upon it over time. And this is all without being asked to do so. In addition to this, a Genetic AI is much less dependent on the size and variety of the information that it's trained off of. You could have an agenda AI that's trained off of all the world's knowledge of workflow automation, for example. However, let's say that as a customer, you would want an agentic AI system that acts a lot specifically like service now. In that case, in point, you would train it specifically off of service now workflows, service now behavior service now's architecture. And therein lies the real distinction. This is just the beginning of a Genetic AI moving into the market. I think moving forward, you will see it branch off into much more specifically trained agents than something that is overall holistic in its response. It is a very likely reality that in the future moving forward, not only will you be doing your job, but you might have to specifically trained, a Genetic AI clones of your work behavior, helping you remove the minutia from your day. Now, obviously that is much further down the line that we are at right now. So what does this actually mean for the service now platform as it exists in Yokohama? Now, I'm a little bit ahead of the game. We will list out the specific functionality for our Genetic AI release on January 29th again, link below to please register for that event. But I think the first thing I need to do is provide some clarity as the nomenclature of this release has people a bit confused with the interface that it's using in the screenshots as well as this name as AI agents. A lot of people have been popularizing the notion that it's something to do with virtual agent like it's a beefier version of virtual agent, which could not be farther from the truth in virtual agent. You are specifically designing conversations and exactly the different type of outcomes that conversation could elicit. You could have a myriad of answers, but you are still specifically channeling people into predetermined buckets. And if you recall, a Genetic AI does not work in that fashion as part of its definition, a Genetic AI is a proactive independently acting entity. So there's no predetermined buckets that you would have to program into these AI agents at all. Instead, the roadmap for our AI agents looks something like this. Let's say, for example, that you work for a company's support desk team, where you do things like addressing tickets that are coming in from your customer base, resetting passwords and escalating things as they see fit. These AI agents could do exactly that completely on their own. It could not only do that around the clock and know when things were routine enough to act on its own, but it would also be smart enough to know when to escalate things for human intervention because optimally, that is the goal of AI. I will say this. AI has had to do a lot to win me over. As far as our team goes, I was one of the bigger skeptics of AI as someone very passionate about art and the human element of art. I think that is initially what triggered such a sour response to generative and subsequently a Genetic AI. But more and more with how I have seen it applied in customer use cases, the more it has turned the tide of my opinion, because I've seen what is really for the goal of AI, with regards to automation in tech in corporate America, it is not to remove the human element. It is to maximize the time for it. It is there to free us up from the countless routine types of tickets that anybody could do. RPA could do it. A really heavy flow could do it. But now we have AI agents that we don't even have to program to do it. Again, this is talking very big picture and where service now is ideally heading towards as a company moving forward. But if you would like to see what specifically AI agents can do in Yokohama, and I will tell you I was blown away by this presentation, please join the live. It's called the AI agent live launch. It is January 29th and I hope to see you there. Now to all the AI nihilists, kind of like myself out there that are saying, ah, this is another big tech trend. This is the same as, you know, putting design wizards and everything and low code and everything. It's just going to be another bump in the roller coaster of corporate America. Let me really shatter that illusion for you. Like I said initially, I have never in my seven years working here and almost 10 total working on the service now platform seen our company invest in a functionality like this. Agents, AI is not just another buzz word is not just another trend for companies to hop on and hop off as the years go by. It is a paradigm shift for what work will be in the 21st century. First, consider the scaling perspective that this offers companies. Sure, AI agents cost money. You will see that in any single platform that offers some form of agent AI moving forward. It's going to cost money. However, AI agents do cost less than another full time employee or even pops simply a part time employee. Now again, that's not as to say that everyone's going to get replaced with AI far from it. Instead imagine something like this every single team from IT to HR, having their own AI agents to handle all the grunt work people put off doing anyway so that they can appropriately scale the human element. And that's not even considering the added impact of decision making that this really offers people for anything that you do in your job. Think of the most routine thing, something that you could do with your eyes clothes in a heartbeat. AI can do it faster. Not only that, but AI can do it in the middle of the night when you're asleep or possibly when you're in the bathroom or on a work break or on PTO. AI doesn't have the human element of rest baked in. So instead of coming back from a cruise like I did with a humongous pile of stuff that really didn't take too much brain power to get through, but took a phenomenal amount of time to get caught up on. What if you came back from PTO and those types of things were already taken care of again, this might be one of the more futuristic steps of a gentick AI. But think about how it can be fine tune to match aspects of real people that have left their impact on a specific process. Let's say that you would set up a gentick AI to handle very specific routine emails a team was getting. And however, good, a gentick AI is, let's say that the responses were coming off a bit wouldn't, but maybe there's a person on your team that statistically has a pretty good rate on return on these type of emails. Maybe it's their style or the speed in which they respond or the time of day in which they do their work, but whatever that is, let's say that they statistically have the warmest response to those type of emails. The gentick AI could be trained specifically off that. It's remember, it's not generative AI. We can make this as specific and niche as possible for the processes that we're utilizing a gentick AI for. Flows and automation were the first step in abstracting away the minutia from people's everyday jobs, allowing them to do that impactful work. The only humans can do an agentic AI is just the natural next step to that process. And before closing up today's discussion about a gentick AI, I want to get a huge shout out to Earl Duke Hay on our team where I have been probably the big, the big spooky nihilist about AI. He has been the AI champion and a lot of the information today that what I've presented on is directly taken from something that he did internally for our team. So I wanted to give a shout out to him and thank him for also helping open my eyes to the prospects that agentic AI is really going to offer. Not only people on service now, but on other platforms and in the corporate ecosystem moving forward. Again, I'm going to keep hammering at home because I'm part of the marketing department. We have the AI agent launch on January 29th, 2025 at 12 p.m. Central Standard Time. So I hope to see you in the comments because I will definitely be there as well. I can't wait to see your actual live opinions on everything baked into Yokohama. Additionally, the day immediately after is tech now. So if you're like, I want to see everything relevant for admins, builders and developers, join us for that webinar. And I will again, I'll include the link to register for that webinar below. As at 10 a.m. Central Standard Time on January 30th. Also, if you've made it this far into the podcast, I have a little sweet treat for you as well. Just a reminder that historically at least there's no confirmation. I can't make any promises, but historically the most recent release available happens to go on to PDIs on EA as well, which is the day we are doing tech now. So not only should you keep your eyes and ears open for information coming out of tech now, but also be sure to keep refreshing that developer. Service now website to ensure that you are one of the first people that gets to experience Yokohama completely for free. Now we're keeping things short and sweet to start off the new year.

Discover how agentic AI can enhance decision-maki",995.0,20250518,395.0,," Hello, everyone. Welcome to another episode of our podcast. Today we're going to dive again into an eGente AI framework and I have another technology leader with me. Ronnie Zeus joins us from Israel. Ronnie, welcome. How are you? Good, good. Thank you. How are you doing? Yes, great. And we're going to dive into awesome stuff today. He's a leader building products for AI ops for a long time bringing a lot of new innovations. I'm really excited to have him on this podcast. Before we dive in, Ronnie, tell me a little bit about the you use Gini TVI in your world. Of course you do. You're making new products, but anything interesting that you do with it. Every day, they are all in our, both exploring different technologies in Gini and personally using. It's really helped me to arrange my thoughts and put together my thoughts into structure ways to make sure that the messages I'm trying to convey are clear and concise. So it's super helpful for me. Yeah, that's ready. I started to use a little bit with my kids to make different images. Try to understand their imagination, what they can imagine, and how Gini TVI tools can help them create something that they are thinking about. So let's dive right in. And I want to, you know, be a deep knowledge of machine learning in AI in a traditional way and now shifting towards agentic frameworks. How does in your world agentic AI frameworks differ from a traditional AI machine learning frameworks? Yeah. So the thing is that when you look on traditional AI and ML frameworks, mainly focus on data processing and pattern recognition and they provide insights and predictions and recommendations, but really require a human intervention for the execution. But when you look on a Gini on the other hand, it introduces a lot of autonomous and decision making entities that actually understand the environment, which is super critical in our space to understand exactly different types of data. It's also have reasoning and planning capabilities to provide solution, which is based on neither historical data or real time context. And it's able to act on behalf of people. So it could be your own copilot or your own little minion that helps you do do. And it's also has the ability to learn and adapt like any other ML and AI form from user feedback and continuously refining their decision. So this end to end actually make the agentic AI far more dynamic and and action oriented than just traditional AI models, which are focused on insights and predictions. Yeah. You're the second person who said the word copilot this week in the podcast I had. Another customer actually said that I think is a concept of, as you said, using it to create actions is really what's becoming very useful for in a daily life, but also for our customers. So let's dive in a little bit into the world we live in that is IT operations. How are you seeing agentic AI enhance the IT operations and maybe some examples of what you're working on and coming up in the near future? Yeah. So if you look on a JTNKIA, this is actually going to transform how IT operations are working today. So it's going to be more focusing on automatic decision making and execution. It will significantly reduce the manual burden on IT teams. So unlike traditional AI, which is primarily analyzed data and provide insights, the agents can autonomously act on alerts and prioritize task and even resolve issues. All while keeping operations in control. So for the IT operations, this means faster resolution because AI agents will triage, correlate and assign task in real time. It will be, you can imagine proactive issue prevention because the AI will be in the position to detect issues that indicates potential failure, potential outages and recommend on execute preventive actions. And it's also reduced the operation load because AI agents will be able to handle a lot of repetitive troubleshooting tasks and letting the operator focus on high-value problems, rather than just another task that I have to perform. So it's going to unleash the power of to empower operators to be much more focused on high-value or critical issues. Yeah, so I guess when we speak in the terms of autonomous and again, I guess we think about various ways. One is autonomous assisted human in the loop, human on the loop. All these are different ways. Customers and enterprise start to adopt it. Do you think about a maturity based on where our customers are? And how would you baseline that maturity if they want to move to an agentic framework? Yeah, so when we think about how our users, our customers will adopt this kind of a technology, what we imagine is how the agentic AI actually takes responsibility on pieces of the entire user journey of our users. So if our users are, let's say, operators or any technology owner, they have their user journey. They are facing alerts and they have to try to ask the alert, they have to investigate them, they have to find the root cause analysis of them, they have to remediate the issue, they have to escalate the issues, they have to create all sorts of tasks or records to other people. All of these tasks are parts of the user journey they are doing on their day to day and we can imagine AI agents take full control over pieces of that journey, but taking full control, nothing the matter of replacing the user, but actually empowering the users because the AI agent will be able to collect the data, analyze the data and bring the bottom line and the decision to the user to take the decision. So the user can decide or let the AI agent do everything automatically or decide to be the one that is taking the decision for each and every step. So it's kind of saving the time of our users from doing the repetitive tasks and doing the deep level investigation and just provide the bottom line to the user and ask them for their approval or the decision. So the agent can continuously do the task for them in an automatic way. I want to like what our CEO Bill McDermott says is we are building agents in the agents in service of humans. So I think that says a lot about the maturity of our customers as they adopted. One question that comes up as we are experimenting with different large language models is there are so many out there now and there are benchmarks so they're right sometimes the entropic lot comes out really well on when coding tasks are asked. Our deep seek actually brought a very good reasoning techniques and we have the GPT models and the mini models doing really good reasoning. So in your world as you're developing new products, how do you see these different models come together to solve specific problems or use cases? Yeah, very interesting. So what we can see is AI agent that can collaborate across multiple LLMs. So you have multiple agents that are able to collaborate and converse between them. Each AI agent is a master of a specific task or a decision. Each one of them can actually use specialized LLM to handle different tasks. So the AI agent they can call API, they can interact with observability tool, they can communicate with other agents at the end of the day each one of them is specialized in at certain tasks. So and each one of them can can work across different LLMs. So the kind of approach that we are taking is that AI agents are integrating across different products, across different domains that are used different LLMs according to their specialized model. And this goal is actually maximizing the AI efficiency while ensuring seamless collaboration between agents and users. Cool. Let's let's try down an example maybe in operations world. As you said before, triaging is really important. Outage, deduction time to detect an outage and then remediate that outage is really important for all the idea operations leaders. So if you think about that scenario that we live in day and day out, how would you need to take framework help that? Yeah. So let's talk about first about our user. Let's imagine an operator that is bombed with dozens or hundreds of alerts a day covering different technologies, different services and applications. They have a real real trouble to understand exactly what is in priority, what is the impact of the issues, does it even matter to anyone? And then after realizing the priority of it, they have to understand the impact of it and what exactly is the issue and how to remediate that. And now imagine that these operators are not always have access to all the different observability tools and they they're not necessarily the one expert in a certain technology. So the AI agents by using different AI agents and integrating and integrating also with potentially external AI vendors or external observability tools with very were able to using this AI agent to process all these information and provide the operator the bottom line of it, which means what is the issue, what is the impact of the issue, who is impacted by the issue and what is usually being done in such cases. Now you have different AI's that are collaborating with each other, each is providing their own insight into it. And then we can actually bring the bottom line plus the action to the user. For example, an action could be do you want me to create an incident for you, the user, or do you want me just to close this alert because it's not that impactful or do you want me to run an automation which is pre-made in our system for you. So the thing is that instead of the user going search and find and ask for people to access to certain tools, the AI agents will do that for them and will bring the insight plus the action to perform instead of them. So it's imagine that the operator instead of just looking on a bunch of alerts, they will look only on the high impacting one, the one that requires manual intervention, the one that requires some level of escalation and all the repetitive tasks will be done for them. Yeah, one thing that you mentioned is so crucial as the enterprises use a regional platform is ability for them to harness the real time and the historical data that is present already in the platform as you mentioned, incidents, changes, problems, and knowledge that is already available to them. The ability for us to provide that real-time monitoring and you know and and cobble that together all of it in a very seamless fashion. And as we building new data fabrics and ability to bring rapid D.P. So we have multiple sets of data, right? I mean in a lot of times we are looking at monitoring discovery data but then there are other sets of data, maybe present in data lakes that may be able to help with this reaging, right? I mean do you think that could also happen in the future? Definitely, you know, you'll have specialized agent in for example finding the right knowledge base article instead of the user going in search for knowledge base articles, reading tons of them just to understand which one is the one relevant. You'll have an agent do that for them and just will provide them the bottom line and summarize kind of a summary of the relevant KBR articles with the exact steps. It could be also an external body of knowledge. It could be an external website which is coming with the industry knowledge. It could be something which we are passing from the resolution notes of past incidents or some relevant changes that happened recently or for something from observability tools. All of that you'll have different agents providing all these insights. Of course not each one of them is relevant for each and every issue. Everything will be orchestrated. So only the most meaningful and the bottom line will be surface to the user with the actual outcome instead of, you know, instead of taking data from all of the places is just bomb the user with all with tons of data. We will just process everything and provide him the bottom line of it. Sure. Blocked on pack here and you're working diligently on this new development. So, you know, we'll bring you back here a lot more of these agents released. Anything you want to tell our customers and who are looking to get into this space in terms of how they can get involved or any other things that we, you know, any outcomes that we didn't talk about that you want to say. Yeah. So a lot of times I'm being asked like, okay, what, why should I do that? What would be the outcome? Why should I invest in adopting AI into my organization? Because it's a big change, right? We need to train our users to now interact with AI to understand exactly the recommendations that are coming with AI to interact with AI to give to provide feedback for AI. There's a lot of, oh, a lot of adoption exercise that has to occur with our customers. And what we are telling our customers is that we need to be focused on the outcomes. What are we going to, what are you going to gain by using it? And it's all it's down to the standard KPIs like increasing the productivity of your users, the manual burden of different, you know, different tasks, being much more proactive and predictive operations. And obviously to lower the MTTR and maybe eliminate at different outages. With this capability, imagine that instead of having a group of 10 operators, you're actually going to multiply that by the number of agents that are going to work and you're not going to hire more and more people to perform more and more tasks. You're just going to delegate a lot to the AI and then your human users will be the one that are going to supervise the AI. Imagine that the new operator will be the one to supervise on AI agents. So instead of being hammered by, you know, different alerts, there will be the one to make sure that the AI is doing the work for them and it will be focusing on the meaningful work. So you're going to multiply your operations just by delegating more and more capabilities to AI. Awesome. And we will leave your contact information as well in this podcast so people can reach out. And I think a plug for everyone is if you want to get involved, you can be an early adopter program. The things that we have done since last year in the IT operations management product helps you accelerate the adoption rates. So you don't have to wait for a certain, you know, CMDB population or generally if you try to look at the data hygiene, you don't have to wait, right? So for all those things, you can adopt these capabilities quickly, experiment and test them right away in matter of peaks without waiting for a longer adoption cycle. And then if you have a high rate data, you want to bring it in, as I said, we have not only the monitoring capabilities to inject that information, but also the data fabric to bring in various data stores. With that, Ronnie, thanks for being here. I know it's very late for you. So thanks for being a great sport. Always a pleasure. And let's get you back here soon. But thanks for coming on board and thanks for your listening."

Joined by Victor Chen, Outbound Product Manager at ServiceNow, we dive into how AI",946.0,20250312,4048.0,," Hello everyone, welcome to another episode of the podcast. Today we're going to dive back into Agente AI again and today I have another technology leader with me, Victor Chen joins me. Victor how are you? Doing well thank you. Why don't you give a quick intro of yourself? Sure, so my name is Victor Chen. I am an outbound product manager at ServiceNow. I cover everything now assist with particularly focusing on our Agente AI as well as our virtual agent. Awesome, just the right guy we need for this podcast. Let's I ask this to every host, how do you use AI in your personal life or day to day things that you do? Any examples you have? Yeah, I mean I've used I use chat GPT since the very beginning and I recently used Microsoft Copa. I was trying to build a power out of made flow on SharePoint. I couldn't quite figure it out. So I just asked Copa, Hey, I'm trying to do this. How do you do it? And you know, it's pretty helpful in giving me the steps and I asked chat GPT to so between those two tools, I was able to get this flow working for a tool I almost never use. I'm not familiar with this. So it was very helpful for that situation. That's nice. Yeah, I typically use even when I creating this podcast, I use a couple of different tools and helps me out along with the tool I use here at Riverside, but also the chat GPT or even Copa. So kind of coming a couple of different things, which is very helpful. All right, awesome. Let's dive right in. It's a whole lot of talk about Agente AI and its framework, but what does it look like in the context of service now platform? Yeah, so service now we built our own Agente AI framework on the now platform. It is native to the now platform. We didn't acquire companies, not a bolt on. And you know, it's additive to the innovations and the investments made to the platform over time, both by customers who built on the platform as well as us who've innovated onto it. And firstly, that means the ability to use now the now platforms data richness. So I'm talking about your user data, your CMEDB, your knowledge and all the external enterprise data that have people that folks and customers have tied into the now platform of the integration hub and soon also the tools available and workflow data fabrics. So like zero copy data, et cetera. So that all that data is what gives Agente the context and the know how to fulfill its objectives. And then there's the workflows that are on the now platform. So all our customers, they have workflows of service now, whether it's for IT, HR, CRM. And these workflows now also become tools for the Agents to call upon and execute where need be. So you got data, you have workflows, you tie that all in in the now platform that's secure and scalable and you have a very powerful starting point error foundation to build and deploy Agents for your work. Nice. Now you talked about a couple of things I want to dive deeper. One of them is data, of course. So what is the maturity of a customer looks like as they start adopting AI agents, is there a data maturity also in there and aspect of that? Yeah, so like, you know, certainly that's a very pertinent question that a lot of our customers ask us like, are we ready for, you know, AI or Agente AI? And certainly, you know, customers to your very first question to me like, how do you use Gen AI in your life? Like customers need to be familiar with Gen AI tools and workflows of both that service now and, you know, in the in the broader technology environment and be comfortable with large language models, large language models, what they can do as perhaps some of their limitations as well. Right? And that's been true since early GPT up to chat GPT up to today, right? LLMs are constantly evolving, but there are always things you need to be aware of, etc. So customers should be able to should look at how they deploy, test and manage Gen AI tools in the enterprise always. This 10 goes for any AI tool. And so that's the kind of governance structure with a thought space, an AI mature company should have us in, you know, service now has that. And like on the technical side, data drives performance of these agents and the LLMs have powered them, right? So customers should have a strong data governance system process when it comes to their knowledge base catalogs, service catalog and tasks, etc. There's also a dimension workflow data fabric. So that allows our customers to get data from business applications, data lakes and a variety of, right of data sources, right? And that kind of data might not be present in service now already, but based on agile methods we have, our customers are able to grab that data and apply it to these agent take or AI use cases. And I think that is seamless for our customers, right? And then the government, we think about data governance. A lot of our customers have this question like, yeah, if the data is present in service now platform, we know that, but when you are grabbing data from external sources, how does all landscape of governance and management looks like? Yeah, exactly. So you're exactly right. A service now doesn't need to be the keeper of all your data. If you want to integrate your data with the now platform, we allow that. If you want, again, zero copy and just connecting to your data lake or your enterprise applications without any of that data leaving that application of the ecosystem, also fine. But we are extensible and flexible to that point. When it comes to data governance, we talked a little bit about that earlier, but at a moral like tactical level, it's make a sure, for example, that your data is clean, that your knowledge base is up to date. So again, data cleanliness is always important regardless of the topic, right? And it's important like if customers are using agents to resolve incidents, for example, then there should be a good track record or a good historical record events that have been resolved in the past with documentation like work notes and you know, you probably have comments or attachments in there. And that's how agents, AI agents can learn and generate resolution plans accordingly, right? So AI agents can generate a plan to resolve it and then act upon that plan. There's a flip side. You want to make sure that agents also don't access any data that you don't want them to have, you know, excluding or kind of managing out outdated knowledge articles, just one example, right? PII is another consideration. The good news, you know, the service now platform, we have sensitive data handling tools that allows you to mask sensitive data, allows you to manage that in a low-code format. So you're not starting from scratch, you know, when it comes to data governance, you know, we provide these tools and the platform itself provides that foundation to accelerate your deployment for AI tools confidently. We work with data constructions and other kind of the partners, right, to make sure like hugging face and others to make sure that we are following the guard rails and guidelines described by other consortiums as well. Yeah, yeah, we have guard rails for our LLEMs, we have guard rails for data usage, privacy, security, you know, all the security and privacy policies that you're already familiar with on the now platform, you know, the equally applied to our AI tools. Nice. Let's dive into the topic that I find very interesting and that's for everyone out there's large language models. There's been of course activity every single day about whether it's open AI or deep seek or cloud. We just saw a couple of models come out versions over the weekend, past couple of days as well. So how do we integrate these various models into building new use cases and how does it use it? It looks like, but what is the landscape of managing these models for our customers looks like in the future as well? What do you see that right now? Yeah, yeah, no, you're absolutely right. Like, you know, the past month has seen a proliferation of large language models by every company's trying to be the best model at the lowest cost and that is good for service now and that is good for our customers, right? And, you know, so in our gentrific framework, we use large, you know, just folks in an effort moment, we use large language models to orchestrate your team of agents, generating those plans of actions and then executing that action or series of actions along with human and user feedback of what we like to call human on the loop. The other way that large language models are used is also used by the agent tools. So that could be, for example, if you want your agents to generate a knowledge article, search for information or run a custom, now assist skill that you've built on the now platform, those also use large language models. And the good news for our customers and for our customers is that we service now, we are also constantly evaluating models to use in terms of performance and price. And when customers use now assist, they have the, they have two options, mainly. They can use the LLMs that we host. And that means, you know, we host the LLMs, there's no customer data leaving the service now ecosystem or being used to train whatever model, right? And customers don't have to worry about double paying for tokens, right? We manage all that. The other way to use the models is just bring is bringing on model, right? So for those of you, for those customers who are familiar with our generative AI controller, we've had that principle for a long time, it's like, hey, you can use your own model to run Genai workflows on the now platform. You can use your own models to run custom skills on now assist skill kit. And then looking forward, yes, you can use bring your own model whether it's open AI and Thropic, Gemini, what have you, right? To run AI agents, virtual agents or other now assist skills. So we are definitely, you know, in the spirit of extensibility and flexibility, we're going to open that up, you know, very, very soon. Nice. And the good thing about the industry is the training cost and the inference cost been just going down so significantly that customers don't really have to kind of worry about a lot of this and with service now giving them sort of a platform where they can apply different use cases together where they're distilled models or, you know, as you said, bring your own model. It just makes a very happy medium for our customers going forward. Yeah. And then, you know, again, the model to your point is just a tool that layers on top of the platform that you have, right? It could be whatever LLM and it's a platform that, again, provides the data, the workflow, the governance tools, the security, all that so that we abstract that complexity away as much as possible so our customers can get time to value as quickly as possible with these AI tools with AI agents. It's an interesting actually it's called Javan Sparadox, if you have heard about it. It's an interesting way of as the technology goes much cheaper the kind of the adoption of that technology or use cases actually accelerate. So for our customers and us as well as the cost of models come down, it just means you're going to have more adoption and easily, you know, you can do more things with it. So that's that's amazing. And that actually leads me to this. One other question is as these models proliferate and technology becomes available in our platform, which I call our platform is very extensive to so many use cases. What are some of the most significant outcomes that our customers can expect? Yeah, I know that's a great question. You know, what I tell folks is the big unlock for AI agents is productivity at scale. AI agents never rest. They operate 24-7. They're constantly observing, receiving issues and taking actions on behalf of whether, you know, it's their end user employees, whether it's perhaps a service desk or, you know, team of fulfilleders. And this enables customers to raise expectations on fulfilling the KPIs and the objectives that your business has, whether that's that's issue deflection or whether that's time, you know, mean time to resolution, eSAT, cSAT, et cetera, right? Like every business has these for example, for HR, employee satisfaction, HR onboarding for example, and for CRM, right, making sure your customers get the resolution they need, make sure your customers are satisfied and happy and come back to you for more, right? AI agents will touch every corner of the business and their ability to automate and their ability to achieve efficiencies. So it's a very exciting space, really. You know, dare say your imagination is really the limit and what AI agents can achieve and what they can unlock for those who are using them. Yeah, that's well said. Just like our CEO says, well, right, as you said, imagination is your limit. And then also, I like what he says about that, our AI agents in service to humans, right? So that's your point as well earlier. As we wrap up, I know it's a lot happening in this space and we're going to have a lot of exciting developments in the coming weeks. How can our customers keep on top of these developments and stay in touch with whatever is next just coming on the agentic framework? Yeah, so this is where I plug all our service now content, right? So we're going to be making a lot of exciting announcements for when we release AI agents to general availability with our Yoke Ahama release on March 12. So definitely stay tuned for that. Yeah, stay tuned on our website. And if you go to servicenow.com, you see we have a lot of information and a lot of things to share, content to share their AI agents. There's always going to be the opportunity to get more in-depth knowledge and to join discussions with your peers on community. If you're a customer on partner portal, if you're a partner, right? And you know, wherever you get your service now, kind of Twitter LinkedIn or I guess I should call it X. X LinkedIn, etc. Right? And of course, I'd be remiss if our customers, if I don't mention our customers should come to knowledge, right? Our knowledge conference in May. And there we're going to show off the future of the Genetic AI at Service Now. You get the opportunity to hear from our product teams. I'll be there. And you'll be able to get a hands-on look on how AI agents will transform businesses and expectations for what AI can do for you and what AI can do on the now platform. So those are the places I would definitely take a look at. So, you know, please, if you have the opportunity, register for knowledge, visit a website. Awesome. That's a great plug. Victor, it was a pleasure to have you on the podcast. We'll get you back here as we get more development going. Thanks for listening everyone. I'm bye for now. Thank you."

I'm your host Fred Champlain, ServiceNow Agile of Angelus, and I'm delighted to introduce our first external guest, Underpodcast, Richard Naster. Richard is a safe fellow, a former methodologist and contributor to the safe framework while at scale Agile. And he's the author of six books, including most recently The Lean Agile Way, a leased business results in the digital era with value stream management. Welcome Richard, it's a pleasure to have you here. Thank you Fred, it's great to be here. Richard, there's a number of topics that we've talked about. We've had some good chats while we've been preparing, and I'd love to just ask you about business agility as our primary topic and get a sense of what's happening. Where are you seeing in industry and as companies are confronting disruptors from numerous technologies? We see AI popping up and of course all kinds of industries. What kind of examples are you seeing out there of this disruption and how are companies taking on that disruption? How are they responding? Yeah, so I think it's very interesting times today. AI is having an enormous impact on all of our lives. And I kind of say that I don't recall any technology that has quickly transformed the business landscape as quickly as AI. And how quickly the technology has been able to be integrated into existing solutions. And we really have no idea yet. We're just at the infancy. And yet there's a lot of things that are being developed which is allowing businesses to operate in ways they never thought before. And I think there's tremendous opportunities for cost savings. I also think it can have a huge impact on organizations to better be able to have greater business agility. Being able to sense and respond to what's happening in the marketplace, getting insights from our customer service data and more. It's really incredible. I'm very excited about it. At the same time, a little bit scared. And I'm glad I'm not 20 years old now because I would think maybe I wouldn't have a job that a chatbot or some kind of AI will take my job. For sure, there's a lot of concerns around what was that future state look like. And right now, as you said in the infancy of this, it's exciting times. But there's trepidation, I think, as well. But what you mentioned is really key though is the sense and respond. We're really taking that to a whole nother level in terms of response time, taking signals, telemetry from our systems, understanding where customer sentiment is, as well as being able to make faster decisions and higher quality decisions as well. So as you think about what those interactions are like and from products and product introductions and updates and refreshes and new features, things are really speeding up. Where do you see the customer centristy aspect of AI? Where do you see that coming to play? Yeah, so one of the things that comes to mind is there's often a lot of weak signals out there that we just can't perceive. So for example, when someone calls into your call center, information is recorded in the database, in the customer service database, or they exchange problems with a chatbot. This data is coming in from many different ways and there's hundreds of thousands of interactions. And there's gold in those interactions. But we often can connect the dots between what people are saying and the signals that they're providing. It's just too weak. We just can't make sense of all that data. We have an explosion of data today, but not able to make sense. So one of the things that I'm excited about is using AI to interrogate the different databases where we have these interactions with our customers and be able to know what complaints that they have, what are some of the ideas they have to improve our products and services. What are the things that they're actually using? We want to make sure what we deliver to the market is actually being used. And all of these things, typically we don't get those strong signals. And when we're doing software development, product development today, we need to understand what's happening. And the world isn't completely homogeneous. So we can't say that one customer is the same as the other. So being able to detect these signals, and then be able to sense what's happening, and then coming up with the ways to respond. And we can actually ask our AI, well, how should we respond to these particular problems, which is kind of cool, which is one replacement human thinking. But it may give us some ideas and some insights on how we can address those problems or issues or enhancements. And also to make sure that they get ratted to the right people. So that's another aspect of AI. I like to think of it as intelligent automation. Some people called agentec AI or agent AI is that it can do a task based upon the information that was presented to the AI. So if you're doing generative AI or using chat, that it can then take the next step. So let's say you call into your cable company, or not call into cable company. Let's say you used a chatbot in your cable company, and you're saying, I can't get a good picture on the screen. And usually you go through a phone call, you've got to get to an agent, they ask you to authenticate you and blah, blah, blah, before you know what, half an hour has gone by and nothing has actually been helping you, right? It's very good. Yeah, yeah, we've all had that common experience. Yeah, it's frustrating. Right. And you get the same experience kind of with some of these chat applications as well, especially when it's not alive, especially when it's a live person, rather, and then go through a script and they can't deviate from a script. Imagine now you have an intelligent bot, and when you speak to it, it then says, okay, well, have you rebooted your router as an example? And you say, no, and it comes back and says, would you like me to reboot your router? Okay, sounds like a good idea. Yes. Then it goes ahead and reboots your router. It knows when the router has been rebooted and says, okay, can you please try again? And let me know if the issue has been resolved. And so right then and there, you can say, yes, or no, if you say yes, it might then go ahead and do another action. This is where the agent aspect of AI comes in, this intelligent automation, and then it goes ahead and closes the ticket. If you say no, well, then it will know what do we do next to troubleshoot your problem? It may ask you more clarifying questions. And based upon all this wealth of information that we have about how to troubleshoot problems, we are going to get better responses. Also perhaps this is not the first time you called in. Most chatbots, if they're not intelligent, will not know that you just called us called last week. But this time it says, well, you called yesterday about this. Is this the same problem? Exactly. Knowing the context, right? The history. Right. Knowing the context is really great. So I think there is a way that we can really improve customer service using AI and then having people. So when you really need to speak to a person, they can actually spend quality time with you. And they're not focusing on the routine problems that are time consuming to respond to, but are easily automated and for customers to feel better about their interactions, especially as we're able to more humanize AI. And perhaps you see an avatar of a person acting as an agent. Perhaps you're even speaking to it in the future. It's not very far off. Right now the main interface has been texted with the chatbot. But I imagine that it will be much more voice interaction with bots and feeling like you're speaking to a person rather than to an impersonal bot. Sure. When we've seen it with Alexa and Siri, right? We've gone that direction. So just now a matter of closing that gap and I agree, it's probably going to become the more common interface rather than typing things out. And so it's really what you mentioned was it's really having that credibility too. Being able to trust and it's not just some script that you're being read back to from an agent, maybe a live agent. And you said that we can actually also harvest from that in terms of the data, the sentiment. Of course we can analyze this in real time as well. And so we can really trust what we're being told. It's engaging, but we're also collecting. And as you said, figuring out behind the scenes what's the next best action. What do we do next as this dialogue continues? So and then we're letting humans really work and add value where humans do the best work. Right? Right. So removing some of that repetitive inquiry and really getting to the hard stuff where we need to put people. So yeah, it's pretty fascinating how fast this is accelerated. Yeah, and I'm optimistic about that, you know, every time we've had a new technology, there's always been fear that it's going to take people's jobs. And while that may be true, I think it will add jobs as much as it will eliminate jobs. So I think there will be a balance. I think we'll better able to use the creative minds of people. So if I'm calling in for customer services, an example, we can take them off the script and make and type things into chat, into general AI to ask questions of their own sources of internal information to get answers, plus be able to query lots of sources of information about maybe this has happened before. What did we do to resolve this in the past? Is this a totally novel problem? You know, is a system down? Can we, we can check that quickly? Oh, yeah, there's an adogenior area. I mean, there's so many different things that AI can augment human intelligence. I don't see AI replacing human intelligence, but it's going to augment human intelligence."

You will learn how various observability AI agents can interact to solve specific use cases. Reach out to us i",784.0,20250227,479.0,," Hello everyone, welcome to a KBDI podcast. We are reviewing a new set of topics and you will see a lot of focus on agentic AI starting this year. So, as you probably know, service now is very deep into the three pillars that comes to work for the fabric that combines all data from different discourses, all your infrastructure and other data sources. Then we combine it into creating action with AI agents and then creating assisted and autonomous workflow. So, as service now unravels this whole space, we will be bringing you with new topics around this. Today, I have an expert in observability and Denika Shae joins us from San Francisco. Hi, Denika. Who are you? Hi, I'm Good. Who are you? Yeah, good, good. So, this is going to be one of the first topics in this space or first episode we're going to talk about. We're going to zoom into the observability world and what does the AI agents mean for that. So with that, before we actually dive in, Denika, why don't you quickly introduce yourself? Hi, yeah, hey everyone. I am Danica. I am a product director in the AI ops team and I lead a bunch of initiatives within AI ops. One of them is building AI agents. That's awesome. Yes. I, that's a great plug actually. This observability is a part of a broader AI ops solution as well. So both AI ops and observability go ahead and end. So we're going to get into both of those things a little bit more today and a lot more in the future. So, as we dive in, Denika, why don't you start with actually telling your perspective or what you think, when you think of a gent dig, when you think of AI agents, what comes to you, what your mind when you think about this space? I think for me, it's mostly like from a pragmatic sense, it's the access to information. So AI agents make access to information, access to complicated information much easier for any persona, right? I think with the rise of AI and LLMs, what the most powerful things about them is that you don't really need to be taking a class or taking a course or being in that data storage system to be able to get this information and understand it. The AI agent with the right access and with the right powers can get that for you and then also summarize it in a way that makes the most sense because it can understand how to explain it to different types of personas. So I think that's to me one of the most powerful but also pragmatic ways to use AI. Yeah, that's interesting. Of course, it makes, if you look at our customer landscape, it makes a lot of sense because a lot of our customers come from this operations or service desk environment, right? So they have different L1, L2, L3 types of responsibilities and depending on their level, they will be dealing with information, as you said, in a very different way or different or different complexities of information is getting to them. So AI agents can help them decide for them or simplify them for you for them. Okay, that's great. So let's get into a little bit of the world that we live in and that is IT operations. And tell us a little bit about how do these agent AI or AI agents will help specifically enhance this IT operations role. Yeah, of course. So the AI agents that I'm building within ITAM are AI agents that collaborate autonomously with third party AI agents from best of breed observability platforms. And so the problem that we're trying to solve is that when an IT operator is trying to triage and investigate an alert, they really need to understand very quickly what is the impact and severity of this alert and which teams and subject matter experts can they pull in to start the investigation. And the complexity is that the critical information to answer these two questions resides in information silos. It resides within service now. But it also most elusively it resides in third party observability tools. And to make the problem worse, these IT operators, they don't often have access to these tools. And when they do the learning curve for these tools is very high, right? They're not built for IT operators with more limited technical knowledge. And so with AI agents, you can sort of like break the barrier of access, first of all, because these AI agents can automatically contact a lot of these best of breed tools. And they can also simplify the information and present it in a way that's very operator-friendly. And so with access to the information, understanding and context of the information, they can very quickly understand impact and severity as well as get enough like nuggets of knowledge to start the investigation with the subject matter experts. Yeah, so I mean, this is great because a lot of times when we talking to customers, they just don't have one, two or three tools. They've had sometimes half a dozen or even sometimes it doesn't tools, right? And it opens more environment when you're monitoring your apps, your microservices, you probably have open source tools. So it just helps them, right? Because it becomes almost a manager of managers kind of approach for a lot of work. That's what ITOM does today. We embrace like an open system, open ecosystem of observability and monitoring vendors. We already connect with them via event management. They can now set, they can send events and alerts into ITOM. And from there, that's sort of the entry point for the IT operator. And our agentic approach is exactly the same, right? In the world of AI agents, we want to be the manager of the manager of AI agents. We want to be the agent of agents. And we want to help the IT operator connect all of these vendors and to be able to facilitate a collaboration amongst AI agents. And it doesn't really matter how the other agents, the other third party agents are built, right? I mean, they could be using their own LLMs, they could be using their own data structures. What matters is the data that comes to service now. Is that the right? Yeah, exactly. And I think also to add on to that, the information that they provide is very harmonious with the information that we already have. So we can take the information that they have based off of like triceps, logs and metrics and combine that harmoniously with the information that we have within the CMDB and sort of like the workflows and post mortems and like previous incidents and alerts. And we can marry that together and give the operator sort of like the best suggestion on what the next step should be. Yeah, there's also this brings up a good topic you mentioned, CMDB. So CMDB is a great way for becoming a providing a system of record for a lot of enterprises today. But even if you don't have a great CMDB today or you're still in the process of building a quality CMDB, this approach can still work, right? I mean, they don't have to be bound down to say that, you know, I need to get my CMDB like 70% to ready state. Exactly. It's pretty much decoupled. Yeah. And I think I mentioned this very briefly in the beginning that whole data strategy the service now has around work for data fabric and the RAPRIDB, which is kind of pretty advanced way of processing your data. That also helps because, you know, we are not bound to a specific data structure or a specific format. It could be able to format. It could be done in a any way that we can ingest that information into service now. So then we also call it a knowledge graph, which is kind of another way of thinking about how the relationships are built. So that's great. Let's go a little bit into, do you want to give us specific scenario? You know, you are working right now in the middle of this huge development and we will see that our development being released in the coming months. But if you take a specific use case, do you want to walk down a specific use case with what you're building with some of the other agents? Yeah. And so, yeah, and I think it always helps to anchor around a very concrete use case. And so the one that, you know, we see a lot, when we work with a lot of e-commerce companies, enterprise companies is that for example, the alert that comes into I-TOM will first be, say, on a application service called the payment service. And so it's the operator's job to sort of understand when they see this alert for the payment service. Say it's like the SLA for availability is breached, right? Normally, it should be 95%. It's now 94%. And so the operator really, in a world without AI agents, they need to figure out what's the impact and severity of the alert and who to pull in to start the investigation. And so with AI agents, now the operator can open, now assist. And automatically, we can detect that, okay, this alert is from vendor XYZ. But given we have an integration with them, our AI agents will just autonomously reach out to their AI agents to say, hey, can you tell us more about the alert? What other entities are you seeing being impacted? Do you have supporting metrics to sort of like support that claim? Do you see any things that might have caused that change? Recent deploys, configuration changes. And this is all information that we can get in real time to help this operator figure out. So, can I snooze or do I really need to go deeper into this investigation for the payment service? Yeah, I think that's a great use case because that comes up a lot, right? In our customers who are doing real time transactions. And they need to make sure that there's no anomalies. Or they can stay ahead of a little bit of anomalies that's coming up. It's a lot of rich data that's out there. But also, talk a little bit about this goes back to more of an AI ops kind of workflow to write. Once we get all this rich data, we're able to free-ogit. We're able to present it to a customer in a more, this could be an element of autonomous aspect versus assisted aspect. Can you talk a little bit about where does autonomous or of AI agents could come in versus assisted? Yeah, I think we want to give that control to the customers themselves. So you can see this in sort of like different layers of autonomy. The first layer, maybe the most conservative, is that the AI agent is just presenting a recommendation. So it's not really acting on it, but it's giving the operator enough information to say, hey, this is what, this is my guidance, kind of take it or leave it. But as we get more complex and integrated with actions that either agents can take on behalf of the user, the user can also in their configuration, set it to something less conservative. So not only is the AI agent telling them what is the rationale for next steps, it's also implementing those next steps. And you can see the most liberal would be it's acting on your behalf and it's just giving you a conclusion of what it did in the last sort of day or two. And so with the first release, we definitely want to tread carefully. We know AI agents are new, people are cautious, there's fears of hallucination. We really just want to summarize and give them the rationale for what is the conclusion that has been made. And then as we launch more, more and more agents, we feel a lot more comfortable in age two or 2026, we can sort of ladder up those capabilities. Awesome. Yeah, that makes sense. All right. So as we get towards the end of this podcast, how are customers can keep up to date and even if they want to get involved in this new developments, what can they do? Yeah, I would say that we are, you know, we have blogs, we have updates from the sort of normal service now channel as we're rolling out more and more AI agents across all of the use, not just AI ops and item. And definitely if you are interested in being a design partner, we would love to work with you to sort of figure out what is your use case and how we can build AI agents to solve your problems, reduce MTTR in your behalf. Awesome. This was just a kind of very snippet, small snippet of what we're working on. And we're going to bring you more of these kind of episodes that you can get up to speed on. Also you can go to servicenow.com. Our main page is loaded with not a lot of new use cases that we are working on. You'll get you up to speed. And Danika, thank you for being here today and we're going to get you back here soon when you have some agents out there working for our customers. But yeah, thanks a lot for being here. Thanks for everyone for listening in until the next episode. Bye for now. Thank you."

I'm your host Bobby Brill and today we're going to speak with the multimedia team. The team that creates the multimedia bits, the video and some of the infographics and all the graphics you see on the dock pages and the YouTube channel and our community channels. That content that helps you learn how service now works. And we're going to talk with Macy Douglas and Dana Haynes and I'm going to chime in myself as I'm on the multimedia team and we're going to talk about how we make all that content to scale as quickly and efficiently and as perfect as possible for you, the customers. So Dana, tell us a little bit about your role here and all that you do to create a lot of the content we see. Well, I help manage a vendor program where we are working with a third party vendor to help us create videos. And then also I run a program where we are training technical writers how to design visual content for their documentation pages. Also Macy, I'm going to talk to you as well. But first introduce yourself and tell us a little bit about your role here. Okay. My name is Macy Douglas and I'm a manager on the multimedia team. I've been working with Dana for the last seven years, but I've been a part of service now for almost eight years now. Your expertise really is in the management and the workflows and you've got a really heavy strong knowledge of service now. Talk a little bit about how that came about. Since I've been with service now for almost eight years, a lot of it has come naturally just from working on various videos on different products throughout the time of my eight years here. I've been here since the Helsinki release. And one thing that I did here at service now was I got really interested in the development of at the time it was the drink your own champagne campaign we did internally. And I kind of took our video asset management that was on a spreadsheet and put it onto service now. So that really also just the self teaching that really helped me learn a lot about the service now platform itself. And my name is Bobby Brill and I've been a video producer for the last 15 years. And here now at Service Now, I'm what we call a content producer. So we're helping to create the videos, develop the voice over program and help to create a visual representation of what the writers are putting down in the dock page as another learning tool to help solve customer issues so that they can use the product efficiently and effectively. So Macy, give us a walk through on how we're building video content because it's not as simple as just setting up a camera and recording. It's a little bit different, correct? It's actually the exact opposite. We don't use any kind of cameras to record anything. All of our videos are done on the product itself. We use, we do screen demo product recordings. At least for this year, our goal is to create over 400 pieces of content, whether that's a video, an infographic or what we call procedure videos. 400 videos. That's a herkyl and feed. So our customers really love videos. They want to see visual examples in our documentation. It's something that they're consistently asking for. So Macy, walk us through as really the person who's helping to push the content forward and helping to develop workflows and bringing all the pieces together, those little intricacies that help us to make the best multimedia content possible. So the multimedia team is kind of like an in-house video production team with the added benefit of we know service now. So we produce content exclusively for the product documentation site. And we also publish our content to the service now documentation YouTube channel. Our team is made up of script writers who have a more traditional, maybe they have a traditional background in writing or learning. And then we have content producers who have a traditional background in video editing, audio production, video, like live video production, animation. And then we have people on the team that are a little bit of both, which is like, which is something that Dana specializes in. She's really good at both things. So what we do is we create the videos and infographics that help explain the various products that service now offers. Those get put on the documentation pages. And then like I said, pushed out to YouTube as well. Our goal this year is to create over 400 pieces of content. So whether that be we do infographics, we do videos that are around three to five minutes that kind of explain an overview of a product or maybe show you how to get started with it. And then we also do procedure videos, which are short less than a minute videos that demonstrate a quick task on a task page on the documentation. So it's showing you maybe 10 steps of how to configure something or set something up. So getting that content into a video script, we have a lot of ways of doing that. Is there any tools that we're using that help us to create faster and at scalable and also kind of stay on tone? I'll talk specific to procedure videos. So again, those are short one minute videos that demonstrate a procedure on a task page in our documentation. And typically the way those are written is it's very like create, to create a new page. You create this, select that, submit this, and then you're done. It's very straightforward. So to get the right tone for our videos and to match a more casual, empathetic, human tone for a voiceover, we're using tools like Gemini or Writer and sometimes even co-pilot. We can continue to prompt it until we get a voiceover tone that matches something that we're trying to put in our video. So instead of select this new page, we might want to say, select this page so you can create your new team workspace. One of the things that we've been doing a lot more of the past couple of years is working closer with the technical, the documentation writers. And but we really put them in a place of, hey, you're the expert and can you teach me quickly? Because I'm not going to go spend hours and hours researching this and learning exactly how to do it. So if they can teach me quickly, I can put that into a script. I'm just mirroring what they're giving to me. One thing I've seen with those tools is like the Gemini or co-pilot is they lean more towards like the marketing side, which we really try to avoid. And it helps a lot when we're prompting the tools they, hey, I want this to be 90% technical and 10% friendly. And I find like that those numbers right there, even though it sounds super skewed towards the technical, it is just sweet spots for our scripts. But AI tools has so much context as to how customers are using a product or why they even are purchasing the product to begin with. And having that little bit of background information really helps write the scripts. Using writer and Gemini tools like those help really help us get the script to a point where we need it to be to create a voiceover. But honestly, Bobbi, I feel like you're more of the expert and you could speak more to that and how you're using writer or Gemini or any other AI tool to create scripts from technical documentation pages. It's fascinating when you use these tools from a video producer, Stan Point and Dana, I think you'll agree with this. Well, we're always working on time. We're always working on how long is this going to take? How long does this much dialogue actually equate to in minutes on screen? And so these tools have been great for us to take something technical, which may be worthy because you're not reading it, but now you're going to hear it. And we're able to use these tools to make it concise, make it friendly. Sometimes we're having to add more friendly things at the end of the video and try it out or things that help make the voiceover feel like a guiding voice along with giving you the answers you need because it's such a, it's a fun way to now make video now. It's new that you're creating on the fly. Well, how do you do that? How do you, you're using a computer generated voice? How do you make that sound friendly and appealing to somebody? It's pretty fascinating how good the tools have been. So like, I'm literally sitting in a voiceover booth with all the voiceover things to do voiceover. But now we're using AI tools to make that consistent. And once you start using these AI tools and finding the right tweaks as we're all finding with all these AI tools, we're getting the tone we like. We're getting those inflections. We're getting not so much drama, but we're getting the really warm and fuzzy guiding tone that we like. And that really helps bring a level of consistency to the content so that when you're watching maybe a series of videos, you can feel confident that what you're hearing and what you're being told is the right answer. And one of the tools we're using, well said, really, we've been working with them a bit to help tweak that out and really get these sounds and renderings of our terminology and our acronyms so that it sounds like you're having that guiding voice with you at all time. When we look at it from a video perspective, voiceover and music were kind of that icing on the cake, where if it was a training video, you should be able to follow along. And the music and the voiceover was there to ensure that you were getting a high quality product. But now when we think about things like accessibility and having that guide with us, it makes it so much better to have a good voice consistently and easy to adjust later as through the process, maybe the steps change. We've got the ability to give our customers everything they need to have success with this maybe only a one minute video. You said you've been working with well said. We've and we have implemented well said for two years now. It has been your favorite change with that tool because as we know, things are like evolving so quickly. I think the biggest change in using well said and now that we're in using an AI tool is just the speed of being able to update the copy as it were because our scripts are always changing. The release date is always changing. The content and the steps may change as the developers and the writers change it. We can go back in and still stay on tone and feeling by just removing lines here and there from the script and updating that it makes it very seamless when we deliver. That's the biggest change in using a tool like well said or any AI tool from when we were using human voiceover. As somebody who's done voiceover, you do it in the morning. It sounds different than it does in the afternoon and if you're sick, there are those subtle tweaks that can slow down production and when we're trying our best to get as much useful information out to the customers quickly as possible, we need that consistency and we need that speed. I remember recording voiceover. They see, remember when we would sit in the room, there would be three of us. One was that person that was actually doing the dialogue and then we had one person that was in charge of recording and then the other person that would watch the script and make sure the words are being said correctly. I remember one time like my stomach was just growling and we had to like re-record stuff over and over and I'm like, oh, sorry. And that's, if I hit my mic, oh man, we screwed it up. We've got to go all the way back again and you're getting in that flow of doing things that it can be difficult. Within the department, we're all working together. We can reach out to each other. We have our tools that we can use and we can change things on the fly. But like many production houses, you're working with one of our vendors and helping to guide and empower some of our vendors to use the tools we're using to then stay on brand and stay consistent and deliver additional product. Can you walk us through how that has worked not only just with the AI tools, but in general how that's changed in the last few years as we've developed a better relationship and workflow with our vendors? Well, when we're working with the vendor, it's very interesting in these dynamics that we have. I mean, the three of us work together where a team we can reach out and actually working with the vendor is very, very similar. They are truly an extension of our team. We meet Chris, another guy on our team. We meet with the vendor one to week and we just see where we're at. I mean, truly, I don't like to use the word. It's like family, but it really is. That's not a bad thing. That's a good thing. Yeah. And it really helps the dynamic. And one of the, we talk about workflow. So we have a script ready. We have a demo ready and we're ready to pass it off to them. And I really think one of the biggest changes we've had in the past couple of years and working with them is they are able to look at a first cut that is done from one of their editors and say, oh, no, this isn't right. I just know they're not going to like this. They're not going to approve it. And that has helped tremendously. So because we have that closer relationship, they know what we want and they're able to be like, nope, change that. So they use the same programs we use and they use the same tools. So like inside of the program, for instance, we use Adobe Premiere Pro and we heavily rely on libraries. So our internal video editors have developed a big library of mogarts and we share that with the video vendors and they just take those and run. And that has helped our videos have this look and their videos would be like over here and it really just brings it together. So the more we develop internally and get our processes, spite, the more helps them. Yeah. So we have a lot of content to produce and it is a it's a shirk you lay in feet to try to do this. But I'm really happy with the team that we have and the tools that we are using and are implementing to help us get to that 400 goal. And Bobby and Macy, I think one of the things our team does really well is one working together but then also testing new tools and trying new things because I don't think what we do right now is going to be the same six months from now. It is like ever changing. So there you go. There's a quick little peek until how all of this content is made and really how it's evolving daily and how the team is not only creating the best content but bringing in some of those best tools to utilize AI at its best."

This course will guide you through designing flowcharts, mind maps, organizational charts, and more—quickly and effor",,,4691.0,," Hey folks, have you ever found yourself scratching your head, trying to create a flow chart but getting lost in the process? You've got a brilliant idea, but turning it into a visual flow chart feels like trying to untangle a mess of wires. Traditional flow chart tools can be expensive and complicated, leaving you feeling stuck and frustrated. But fear not, because there's a revolutionary tool at your fingertips, introducing chat GPT. Chat GPT isn't just for conversation, it's your secret weapon for creating flow charts in a snap. And guess what? It's completely free. Without further ado, let's dive into exploring the process. This is Perves Dharani and you are watching Guru Tech Solutions. First of all, open your web browser. You have chat GPT before you. We have already decided our topic around which we want to create flow chart. As we are interested to create flow chart around discussing the steps to carry out an academic research. Let me paste my copied prompt over here. You can see we have asked chat GPT to provide us the steps for academic research. Besides, we have asked to write steps for each research methods. As we know there are three different research methods. These include quantitative research, followed by qualitative and mix method research. Once you are done with this typing, hit enter and wait for the process to be completed. Here you can see chat GPT has created a comprehensive list of steps to carry out academic research. So this begins with general steps in academic research. You can see there are different steps that start from identifying the research topics and ends in reflecting and revising. Further as per instruction, it has written steps for each research method. Here you can see it started from qualitative research methods, followed by quantitative research, and then it has listed down the steps for mixed method study. Now we want to create a flow chart for these following steps. In order to do so, again in the prompt bar, we will instruct chat GPT to create the flow chart that illustrates steps for carrying out academic research. Besides, we have explicitly mentioned to incorporate the above steps that has been created by chat GPT. Further, we have instructed to ensure that related steps are placed side by side. These prompts will be provided in the description below, so you can create your own prompt using these samples. Once done with typing, hit enter and this free AI will create a flow chart for us. Here you can see the flow chart. However, we are not done yet. In order to have a perfect flow chart, we will be converting this flow chart into Mermaid code. Later these codes will be pasted in separate free AI to create stunning flow charts. Let's ask chat GPT to provide us the Mermaid code for this flow chart. Here is AI generated mermaid code. Let us copy this mermaid code from here. Now here comes the next step. Let's open a new tab and this time type drawio. From here, let's hit the very first provided link. This will take us to the official page of this completely free AI tool. Drawio actually generates stunning flow charts. So let us open a new separate file and let us set the name as academic research and then hit create. So here is the workspace where we will be creating our flow chart. As we have already created mermaid code and this is the time to use those codes. In order to use those mermaid codes, let's hit insert and from here, let's click advance and then we will click mermaid. So this is the space where we will paste our code. First, let's delete the existing code. Now let's press control plus v to paste the code over here. Then hit create and we are good to go. Boom! Here is the flow chart. However, it is not the final look. Drawio has created a comprehensive flow chart for us. Now you can play around and make changes as per the need. A detailed flow chart and the connections between each step can be seen. This is the time to play around and make some changes to make it more appealing. First, let us make changes in the text by clicking here. You have got numerous options to play around. We can change the font size and let's make the font bold this time. And we have got many more options. So in this way, you can make changes as per your needs and requirements. Now let's click style and make changes in colors. Here we have got numerous color options. Let me apply these colors to some of the options. And this, the final look of the flow chart after choosing various colors. Likewise, we can make other changes. So here in general, you will be able to see different shapes. In order to make these shapes part of our flow chart, we just need to drag and drop the shapes. Under the general button, you will be able to see numerous shapes. Just under this, we have got MISC. Here you can see numerous other resources that can be included in the flow chart. This time, let us insert a table in our flow chart. We can do it in a single click of a button. Further options can be seen over here. Next, the important thing is an option to replace the arrows. Here, we have got different options. Let us check out arrow style. And it can be adjusted in a single click of a button. So in this way, you can make changes to the flow chart manually to make it more appealing. Once you are done with all these changes, it's time to download the AI generated flow chart. In order to do so, let's click File. And from here, let's hit Export. And here we have an option to download the flow chart in numerous formats. You can choose your desire format as per the requirement. In our case, we would prefer to download the flow chart in JPEG. Once you click, you have this option. You can choose these options as per the requirement. Once done, hit Export, and it will be downloaded into your system. So let us open it from the system. Here is the downloaded version of AI generated flow chart. You can see this is the stunning flow chart, which we have created using Chat GPT and Draw I-O completely free.

Have a question or co",1012.0,20240910,292.0,," You're listening to Accelerate, a service now podcast series about achieving your business outcomes where we talk about how to get the most value from the now platform. Hey everyone, this is Crystal Clevver. And this is Deidrease. Wear your hosts and excited to talk to you about ServiceNow Value Acceleration Solutions that include expert services, training and impact. It gives me great pleasure to welcome Mike Brickner to the show today. Hi, Mick. Hi, Crystal. Thanks for having me. Thank you for being here. So why don't you tell me what your role at ServiceNow entails? Sure. So I'm a service offerings manager in our customer outcomes function. And specifically, I help and manage our service portfolio for our expert services or professional services organization. And my role entails designing, building, launching, optimizing and improving and just managing the lifecycle of the different services that our expert services function delivers and our consultants deliver. So that's helping identify opportunities for services that are going to bring value to our customers, bringing together the different experts across the company to help design and build and then launch those services. And then there's a continual service improvement aspect of this too where we're reviewing services and the different engagements of those services and just looking for opportunities to optimize and improve those services and just bring more value to customers through expert services. Very good. Thank you for that. So I imagine that there are different types of services you're responsible for. Can you tell me a little bit more and tell me how they're categorized? Yeah. When we talk about our service offerings and our portfolio of services, we typically break them down into three main categories. So there's implementation services, advisory services, and then optimization and remediation services. And we have examples of varying size and scope of offerings in each of those categories. Okay. So let's just start with implementation services. And if you could expand on what they are, who they're designed for and what they consist of. Yeah. Implementation services are probably our most common service. It's typically what customers are looking for at some point in their service now journey. And probably the most common type of service that our experts deliver. It's helping customers enable a new solution or maybe expand an existing service now solution that they're already using, but are looking to kind of take it to the next level. And these implementation services is really how you get to value, right? Helping enable and deploy service now applications on platform and in your instance. These are often for net new customers. So customers that are new to the platform, implementing things for the first time, but also existing customers who are expanding on the platform, maybe to other workflow areas or adopting or implementing more advanced applications and processes. So it really applies across all customers. And at some point in your service now journey might need help implementing. Right. And they probably apply to all of our workflows, I presume, right? Yeah. We have examples of services for all of our workflows across the categories. So if you were to pick one that you could go a little bit deeper on, which one would that be in the implementation services area? Yeah. One example that I'd love to talk about is called implementation design. It's a newer service and that we put a lot of effort into designing and launching relatively recently. This one's not a full implementation service. Instead it focuses on understanding the customer's desired outcomes and then designing a solution using all the platform capabilities available, as well as like leading practices and design practices to essentially create a design that the customer can take with them and then implement either with expert services or with a partner or maybe they self implement. And there's multiple reasons why customers are looking for a service that focuses on the design activities first and only. And one could be that they have unclear design requirements or scope. So it would be hard to try and estimate like what a full implementation would look like, what it would cost, the duration of it. So you can kind of take a modular approach and start with the requirements and the design first. And that's really kind of a key use case. And then the customer would have a good understanding of the required investment level and the effort that would go into configuring and implementing that design. And this design could apply to any workflow or most workflows that we support today, right? Yes, this is one service that applies across all of our workflows. So if you can think of an application or a capability in any of the workflows, then we have workshops and other activities as part of this offering to help design a solution using those capabilities. Okay, that makes sense. You also mentioned advisory services, right? And what's the difference between those and implementation services? Because I presume that when you sell and when you deliver an implementation service, you do advise our customers. So what's the difference for people who don't know? Yeah, that's definitely true. Our implementation services typically include some aspect of advisory sessions, enablement that sort of thing. Advisory services are more of like a standalone advisory service. So they usually include like some sort of assessment that could be like a manual assessment where a consultant goes in and reviews your instance, customer's instance and comes up with recommendations. It could be an automated assessment using something like our health scan tool or scripts. Sometimes it's a little bit of both kind of leveraging both automated and like a manual assessment. And then based on the assessment, advisory services will always include recommendations based on leading practices. So you'll get findings from that assessment and then specific recommendations based on those findings. And that's typically where the advisory services stop. We don't take the next step to actually implement on those recommendations and on those findings. But those findings and the recommendations are all kind of packaged up for the customer to take the next steps with. That makes sense. So you mentioned using our health scan tool, for example, but are there other specific services you can talk about or maybe one that would be of interest to our audience today? Yeah, we have a few in this area and some are product specific. One that's near and dear to my heart because I have a background in service catalog and service portfolio and IT service management is a service called service catalog unified. And again, this is an advisory service. So it includes an assessment of essentially a customer's service catalog and request management posture and maturity. And a consultant will come in and do an assessment, mostly a manual assessment, looking at the different catalog items and like the health of your request management process. And the nice thing about this one and the reason it's called service catalog unified is because they'll not only look at the catalog items and the workflows and requests you have in your service now instance, but also those that you might have in another tool or on another platform in your environment with the goal of bringing together recommendations and consolidating all of those catalog items or workflows on your service now instance and create like a one stop shop for request fulfillment. So to facilitate that, there's also workshops that are included as part of this service. They focus on service catalog and request management processes as you can imagine. And there's also demos that the consultant will provide around different service catalog tools like catalog builder, flow designer, employee center. And those are all tailored based on the findings of the assessment and basically the maturity and posture of your service catalog processes. So for example, if the findings suggest that using order guides would be like a great way to bring together a bunch of related catalog items and workflows that might be spread out across your environment, then we'll take extra time to focus on order guides as part of those platform demos and basically enable the customer on that tool, that capability, that application so that they can take those findings and act on them. And this one's typically a seven week engagement. And again, you walk away with those findings and recommendations for next steps along with the enablement through the workshops and the platform demos. Well, you must have read my mind because I was wondering how long your services typically take. So this one is seven weeks. So one, you mentioned before implementation design, I presume it varies depending on the workflow. It does. It varies by workflow and because of kind of the modular nature of that one, there's multiple tiers as well. So every workflow has one, I'm sorry, two to four tiers available depending on the number of workshops and applications and processes that you want to cover and design for. That makes sense. So it's going to vary the amount of time you spend where the customer is going to vary based on the workflow and the tier that they chose. Yep, exactly. Right. And last but not least, you mentioned optimization and remediation services as the last category. What are those services? Yeah, optimization and remediation services are similar to advisory services. They kind of fall in between implementation and advisory in a way. So typically those start with again, some sort of assessment that's focused on identifying improvement opportunities and then helping define a backlog of of those improvement opportunities or development tasks that would need to be carried out to remediate or optimize a solution. And then typically you get time with one of the consultants to do hands-on remediation and optimization. So the consultant will work with the customer based on that backlog that they define and take a set amount of those stories and the consultant will actually help implement, configure those stories and those solutions as part of the engagement itself. So it's like advisory with kind of an implementation. Yeah, both of that. Yeah, so it's like a hybrid a little bit right between advisory and implementation. You just take the advisory a little bit farther. Absolutely. Okay. Is there one specific service you can talk to me about that falls in this category? Yeah, probably our flagship service in this category is one called CMDB Amplified. It's another product specific offering that focuses on CMDB and related processes and applications and tools. This one starts again with an in-depth assessment. The consultant comes in and looks at the health of your CMDB and they also use the CMDB data foundations dashboard as kind of a means to help them assess but also to enable the customer because you can use that dashboard to kind of monitor the ongoing health of your CMDB and track your progress and maturity using that dashboard. So you get enabled on the dashboard along with the assessment. Then you'll work to prioritize kind of the key findings and like those remediation stories. It also includes workshops and coaching much like an advisory service would. So with CMDB Amplified you get workshops on CMDB governance. There's workshops on our common service data model which is an important thing to understand along with CMDB and then you get the remediation. So essentially the configuration or implementation of a subset of your remediation stories. And for CMDB Amplified you actually get 20 hours of remediation time with a service now consultant. So whatever stories make the most sense to implement and leverage our service now consultant for in those 20 hours that that's what you can can walk away with along with all the other kind of prioritize stories. This one's also a seven week engagement so similar to service catalog unified. You walk away with the remediation, the prioritize stories and a little more enablement and understanding of CMDB and the dashboard that you can use. So finally what would you recommend to someone who is interested in learning more about all of these services you talked about? Yeah, the most important thing for us is that our customers get to value and can effectively enable all the platform capabilities to solve for their business objectives and desired outcomes. I think the best thing for you to do if you're interested in expert services or any of the offerings that I mentioned today or anything in our portfolio is to reach out to your account exec. They can put you in touch with your services account executive who can help advise on which services might make sense provide more detail on maybe a specific offering that you had in mind. Perfect.

10,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it1hcs5S1ks,Digital & AI transformation in the Public Sector,Digital & AI transformation in the Public Sector,ServiceNow Community,"In this episode of the ServiceNow Executive Circle podcast, Gina Gill, Chief Strategy Officer at the Governments Central Digital and Data Office (CDDO), discusses how technology transformation offers ",1136.0,20240911,151.0,," Hello, I'm Cat Finch and welcome to the latest episode of the Service Now UK Night Executive Circle podcast series. Within our podcast we speak to some of the industry's most exciting innovators, thought leaders and senior executives, all with the aim of giving you our listeners, the inspiration, insights and market intelligence you need to help drive your organisation forward. This week we're speaking to Gina Gill, the Chief Strategy Officer for the Cabinet Officers, the Digital and Data Office. Welcome Gina. Thank you very much, I'm delighted to be here. Now in this role that you've obviously been in for a few months, you are focusing on the new Government's digital strategy and delivering of transformation. I was really keen and interested in what you were saying about building the strategy, the building the foundation sorry for this digital future for government. In your view what's critical to the foundations that you're building? So I think that relates to the reason that I moved to the centre in the first place, so there were two reasons that I moved. The first was I couldn't see where we were going as Government Digital and Data, so I couldn't see the vision that brings us all together. We're over 20,000 people working across many different Government's departments and then if you add health and local authority into that then that number gets much, much, much bigger. And I couldn't get a sense of what we're collectively trying to do, so I felt like we were building some great digital services and isolation but actually not necessarily solving that end-to-end user experience across different departments, across different services, across different agencies. So that was reason number one, having that clarity of where we're going. And then number two was things that we have called system reform, I hate the name, but it's things that slow down or prevent digital delivery within departments. So you know things that if you speak, if you speak to a hundred colleagues, the list the kind of same things that are frustrating. And those are things that I think the centre is best placed to resolve and has to resolve. And it's things like money and incentives, so how we fund digital work, which isn't really aligned to digital delivery and it doesn't help us to deliver in our way. It is much more aligned to kind of big infrastructure, not technology infrastructure, but big infrastructure projects and programs and big waterfall programs. So that's an issue for people. Incentives I think is the other thing, so I don't think we incentivise departments to work together. So how do we, how might we resolve that? So if you're having some interest in conversation for the Treasury about that and thinking about about things we might be able to do in that space. And related to that is, you know we talk about efficiency a lot, but again we don't, we talk about efficiency within kind of a department or an agency's budget, not across the system. And lots of, and I think lots of the efficiency that we need to create is across the system. So you know, you think about justice. The cost of recidivism is 18 billion pounds a year. That doesn't sit in an individual department's budget, right? That's the cost to UK PLC. How do you get after that? How do you create the incentives to get after that? So that's money and incentives. The second area from use capability, and I don't mean capability within digital and data colleagues. I think, you know, we've been, we've made, we've made quite a lot of really good inroads into that. But more broadly, I think there's still a lack of understanding of what digital means across the civil service and across senior leaders in the civil service. I think we still see it as a back office function. We still see it as a cost space. And we don't really see it as frontline delivery. And a lot of it is now frontline delivery. And so there's something about how do we change? How do we help to help people to like, unbetter understand digital and how it can enable a different way of delivering services? And then last but not least, is how we buy things and work with industry? We're still very, and we've got lots of kind of different frameworks. We did G-Clide, but we still predominantly work with the same really big suppliers. We don't, we haven't done as well as we would have wanted to. I don't think in terms of working with smaller, with like SMEs with smaller suppliers, with people who might have new and innovative technologies that might help to build better experiences. And I think there's a real opportunity in that space as well. And a real opportunity to think about how do we go from innovate, like how do we go from kind of testing things to then actually kind of full on delivery without running, you know, many, many procurement processes, lengthy procurement processes along the way. Definitely. So it sounds like part of your strategy when the initial stage is going to be a bit of an internal change management piece. Like so that kind of cultural mindset shift to thinking about how digital can align a lot of these different government departments. I think that shared service, the interoperability between all the pieces really needs to come together to overcome some of the legacy technology and the silos that exist. Is that going to be part of your strategy that we're trying to do? So it would definitely be part of the strategy. And I mean, what we're talking about is cultural change, right? And cultural change across an organisation, a system that has been in place for a very long time. So that's not fast and it's not easy. But I think we have to say a really clear picture of where we're going. We have to say I kind of what the next kind of three to five years will hold. And then we have to talk about those kind of foundational pieces. And what we're going to do to address those over that period as well. So with the new government encouraging the notion of doing more with less and using technology to improve efficiency, there is a real need to not just build that longer term digital strategy that is robust, but remain agile and respond to the political, the economical and technological changes that are inevitable and that are happening as we speak. Yeah, look at it's hard. It's hard and it's hard in a system where where we know that every five or three years we'll have a potential in a new government in a different direction. So I think we need to separate where we're going long term and set out a clear long term vision. And that has to be something that is hard to work with. And so I think it has to be grounded in service and public service. And I think it has to be grounded in the user experience that we wanted to create for members of the public and for businesses. And so that could be things like that could be things like we don't want people to have to share their data, same data with us all for another again. It could be things like we want interactions to be simpler. We want interactions to be seamless. We don't want people to need to understand which department they're interacting with or which service or form they need. So I think you can set up that picture of if this is what we want it to look and feel like in the future. And then work with each government to look at how you prioritize which services you focus on. During that particular period. So for this government, for example, it might be planning. So aligned to the mission for growth. So I think it's yes, set out the long term that's hard to argue with the kind of transcends political parties and elections and then use kind of each new term to focus on the priorities of the government at the time. It's a really difficult balance, isn't it, between the people that you're working with and how to make that shift and change in government to really what citizens expect. They've got apps, they're using TikTok. They are digital first, digital natives and they've got lots of ideas and they don't want to sit on a phone anymore. They don't want to talk to a virtual agent anymore, sorry, a call center agent anymore. So in your view, what technology do you think is needed to try and get that balance? What the milestone is the kind of build forward? So I actually try not to think about technology. Because I think technology changes so quickly that we're in danger of saying we're in danger of setting out a strategy that says, yeah, we're going to use this particular technology to reach this goal. I think we really need to focus on outcomes and I worry that in the past we kind of go through phases of different buzzwords. And when I first landed in government, it was RPA. So you know, robotic process automation. I was a reddit, a strategy I was at meeting a few months ago where they were talking about robots. And I genuinely thought they meant physical robots until I realized they meant they didn't mean physical robots at all. We were talking about robotic automation. And you know, and as you know over the past, Euro say AI is on, as the word on everyone's lips. And I think that if we get too caught up in the technology, we ended up, we end up implementing technology for technologies sake, potentially putting lipstick on a peg and not actually solving the problems that we say out to solve. Like when Jenny, I burst onto the scene, I was at the MOJ at the time and I would get people emailing me from like that I had never met before in your organization. I've got a great idea here. I think we should do this from an AI perspective. You know, we can do like AI prison visits. I don't even understand what that means. So yeah, so I think we have to really kind of make sure that people get excited about the problem that they're solving and not about the technology. I completely agree. I had a fantastic conversation with Sally Ann Hick. She's the global VP automation experience. And she's a huge advocate for focusing on the business outcomes first, the challenges that you're trying. And actually, AI might not always be the natural answer to the question. There is a journey, there's an evolution of what you're trying to achieve based on what those challenges are. And speaking of challenges and the foundation you're trying to put in place, do you see re-skilling and upskilling and then the general digital skills piece has a challenge or a bit of an opportunity with your team and your department? I think it's an opportunity. And I think, look, the excitement, so the one thing that AI has done is it's opened the door to many conversations that we weren't having before, which is a good thing. And I think that that helps us then to have conversations about skills. And when we last spoke, I talked about the fact that that doesn't mean that we need to turn everyone into a techie for a format. I think it's much more about having the skills to be able to operate in a digital age, which really is an age of change, constant change. And so it's about being able to work with people with different skill sets. It's about being able to really focus on what is the problem that we're trying to solve and what is the experience of the user that's using the service. It's much more about the ability to think, literally, to solve problems. And the desire to understand how other people are solving problems, I think, and kind of trying to bring some of that back into government. Exactly. There's a lot more just to skills. It's more about the digital literacy. How do you interpret the data? How do you... I mean, I've seen job roles advertised for AI prompters, so people are actually working out what do I need to prompt AI to get the information out. And that's a skill in itself. I think we have to not ignore the human intelligence that goes with the artificial intelligence. And there is a skill to that. There's a skill to being the human in the loop to make sure that you're using the technology in the right way. Absolutely. And there's an interesting debate about actually, do we end up with human skills that are actrifying because we're replacing them with technology. So people lose the ability to bring that human lens and how to keep the right balance. And I think CDDO has been working on a framework for where AI shouldn't be used or how to think about where to use AI, particularly generative AI. And we had the same kind of linked at the Ministry of Justice. And it was, in some cases, it was specific to different business areas. So, for example, in courts, it's an absolute red line in terms of technology-making judgments. That's just not a line we're willing to cross. And therefore, it's, I guess, relatively easy in that space to say this is where the line is. I think it's actually harder in other spaces to say this is where the line is. But those are the conversations we need to be having. I think it's introduced, sort of, touched there on a little bit of almost like a bit of a digital divide and not losing the human skills that we have if we rely solely on technology. Actually, you could see, they talk about things like AI and technology being able to bring that digital divide together. But there's also an opportunity to challenge the Earth, a bit of a fear that it could expand that divide because, like we all use the calculator and I'm terrible at mental arithmetic, we don't want to lose the abilities that we have just because we then become solely reliant on technology. Absolutely. I think that's a real progress, definitely. I think another area that's interesting with this sort of human and the artificial intelligence is the sort of the bias around AI. I don't know if you've seen the latest TV advert with Dove. I don't know. I haven't actually. It's really powerful because they sort of type in to the chat, but give me a photo of a beautiful woman. And so, of course, it generates what it thinks is a beautiful woman. And then you can put in the information, say, give me an image of what is a Dove beautiful woman. And that's when you get back the images and their different sizes, different colours. And it suddenly becomes more representative. And I think there is a fear, though, on what that bias is. If we don't put in the right data, especially for you, I think with that customer first mentality and looking at your citizen experience, you have to get that data right. You don't want to put anything bias into your systems because you're then going to be getting the right user experience out. Absolutely agree. But I also think that there is so much data that sits across government. That is, it's subjective, because again, going back to M O J, case notes, and I say just damage in health, adults are case notes. So there's lots of that type of information in data that sits in government. And you need to that information. And that information will likely have some level of bias in it, because as humans, we all have a level of bias. So it's about how do you make sure that you're not amplifying that bias? And I think that's hard. And I think we only find that by experimenting safely, but experimenting to see what level of kind of accuracy we get when we test AI in different scenarios. And then we have to make decisions on whether that level of accuracy is good enough, and whether it's good enough for public service particularly. Definitely. I think that's where AI has a very positive force. It's creating this curiosity. There's such curiosity about what we can do with technology. And I think that's possibly the biggest opportunity that it has given a lot of us at the moment. Yeah. The other thing that I went to speak to some policy people of my old job, and they said, come and speak to us, do you know about AI? I'm sorry, I can't come and speak to about AI, but I'll also speak to about some other thing. And they asked the question of how do you think what impact should you think this will have on the way that we work? And for me, it was an opportunity to say, actually, I think that we should be sat side by side building this technology. I mean, we should be doing that anyway with technology, but particularly with Genie AI, where you are testing and retesting and fine tuning the technology. I think it brings operational colleagues, policy colleagues, digital colleagues closer together. And I think that can really be a good thing. Definitely. And do you think it's made, are you talking about sort of legacy technology and sort of government, government departments have been around for a long time? Do you think it's enabled sort of the younger generation to look at your role, to look at what you're doing and actually see it as quite a more exciting than perhaps they used to and you're sort of seeing that sort of a sort of interest in getting these new digital skills and joining your workforce? That's an interesting question. I don't know, you know. I think that, what do I think? I think that when people look at government, they still have an image of what that's like in or civil service and they still have an image of what that's like. And so I think it's hard for people to kind of connect to that. Imagine and see themselves in those roles. So I think where the thing that is more likely to influence people is where we are talking to people and they can see where normal human beings and actually, and we're grappling with some quite interesting problems. That for me, that for me is more powerful than any kind of individual technology and getting people excited about these types of roles. Definitely. Or not. You're a perfect face for it. I mean, you talk so eloquently and yeah, it's quite inspiring to hear about your vision.

So a topic that keeps coming up and is actually being talked about as a trend for next year, but I know that ServiceNow is really talking about it and I know that we're already doing it is a Genetic AI. Now what is it? So the way I think about a Genetic AI is imagine having lots of bots, right? Everybody's, most people are familiar with a bot and a bot does something. If you can get bots talking to each other, then you can get them to make some decisions. So let's say you've got a bot that can look at tickets for IT and you've got a bot that can look at provisioning of technology. If you get those two bots talking to each other, they can say, well, I've got a problem here. Oh, and the other one can say, well, I've got a problem here, is my problem caused by your problem? Oh, well then let's see if we can solve our problems together. And that's with the concept in very crude terms of what a Genetic AI is about. So this is where you're going to start to see the opportunity for different technologies to interact with each other. So let's say you've got a Microsoft, Microsoft Copilot and now assist interaction together is actually a Genetic technology. It's two AI technologies working off of each other. It's now assist saying to Copilot, hey, this user had a failure of their IT the other week and by the way, the license they've got for that software they're not using. And Copilot going to the user and going, hey, did you know that you've got some software you're not using and your laptop keeps failing? You do a new one. So that's an example of a Genetic technology very simply. And so with that move businesses away from being reactive to being quite predictive, like, oh, I've spotted a few trends here, like those licenses, I can actually preempt the next 100 people who are going to come to me and say, my licenses run out because actually I already know now from that example. So it's kind of like you can imagine each bot, like a domino effect, each bot will knock onto the next one, the next one. Yeah, exactly, exactly. And actually you leave me onto one of the things that I'm most excited about as well is this thing called knowledge graph. So using the bots and using this Genetic technology, we can augment systems to work off of each other. Right? Now, we're a workflow engine. We happen to show up as an ITSM tool, an HR tool, a help desk tool, a wrist tool, etc, etc. But we are fundamentally a workflow platform driven by AI. And there's lots of uniqueness in our what we do. But when you start thinking about what we actually know, we know so much about where you are, what you're working on, what your laptop says, what software you're using. And so what that means is that when you get to that mass personalization using something like the knowledge graph, we can actually sit down and say, hey, you've just called in because I don't know, I had banked this up today was, oh, 70% of our calls to the help desk are password and recess. I'm like, really still? Yes they are. Okay. Well, this technology can say to you, well, I know you've got a Mac. So I'm not going to show you the Windows version of that password reset. I'll show you the version that's just for you. Oh, and by the way, I know you haven't done your password reset. This isn't the third time you failed to do it. I'm going to recommend the calls for you. So that's where you use things like the knowledge graph to personalize the experience for the consumer, for the employee. But then as a business, you can say, well, hang on a minute. Why have I got 5,000 licenses of this and only three of them being used? Why am I paying for that? Why am I, how many people are actually working on this project? And that, that with the knowledge graph then suddenly becomes a really insightful use. Then you can start to getting to the unknowns, right? The unconscious incompetence areas where the technology can go, I keep seeing this issue come up. I keep seeing this issue come up. Every time I see this issue, you tell me to do that. Do you want me as the AI technology to change your policy? Oh, yes, please. Click. I've changed the policy. The incidents have come down because everybody's happier. Because now the policy matches reality. And that's an evolution, I think, that is going to be very exciting in 2025. It's amazing. How many times even human beings are like, oh, if so and so had spoken to so and so, we wouldn't be in this predicament. Precisely. And so, do you see, obviously, the examples you've just given were very much password resets and things like that. But I mean, I'm thinking of these things that always comes up in our local area. There's a lot of road works around where we are because they've just dug up the road for one water pipe and then the following week they're digging up the road for electricity. Imagine if they spoke to each other, do you see those kind of applications, like if an organisation sort of had that, you know, one bot that's looking after the water pipe, maintenance, infrastructure and the other bot that's looking after the electricity infrastructure, oh, we'll just dig it up once. Wouldn't that be cool? Yeah, so that's a great example of it on a business to business environment. Yes, because when you're running a business and you think about all the things you do, you repeat too many things, time and time again. Oh, we're running an enablement session for team ABC and next week we're running an enablement session for team ABC. Well, why don't we do one enablement session for team ABC and actually do it once and do it properly. So there are lots of business to business examples of where the technology can help with the bot to bot conversation, the agentic conversation to simplify and make the processes run smoother. Okay. I mean, I've seen examples of… Well, I've seen examples of organizations whose expense management process where they have different technologies takes people three or four hours to log an expense claim, even today, right? Now, with agentic technology, you can remove all of the unnecessary out of that and simplify and streamline just as one example, right? And there's loads of areas. If you're running a business, you know where the pockets are. Probably not when you're sitting in the C-suite, but I guarantee you the people who are doing the doing know where those issues are. And by freeing them up and allowing the agentic technology to then help them iterate, you can really make some fundamental changes and we're all looking for productivity gains. We've been looking for those ever since, you know, Cain's wrote that paper and then many years ago, nearly over 100 years ago. We've been elusive productivity gains and I think finally we're able to unlock a lot of those for everybody. Well, that's fascinating and finally you've actually managed to explain it in a way that I get, hopefully I listen is going to understand, I think that's fascinating. And it's not that complicated. Honestly, we put this gloss over the fund of this technology sometimes just to create this allure that we're unique and special. Technology is actually quite straightforward if you just take the time to learn it. So obviously you're speaking to a number of organisations around Europe, around the globe, other than agentic AI being big next year. Are there any sort of other common similarities and trends and things that you see coming up? Yeah, no, I think one of the fascinating things was in 2023, 2023, 2024, end of 2023, beginning of 2024. We saw a lot of the hype, a lot of, oh, we all need AI, we all need AI, woo! And then we got into this cycle of taking the technology and trying to find the problem. And that created a lot of frustration and a lot of, er, why is it not delivering? And I think we're coming to that point where organisations are going to hang on a minute. Let's use this, let's deploy this technology in the way we've always done it. Let's look for the use cases, look for the ROI, build the fundamentals and let's build this as a business case. And we saw during that period as well this kind of, er, outburst of, we're going to build our own language model, right? And everybody's suddenly going, actually that's probably not such a good idea. In my 30 years of technology, build has never actually been the most cost effective way to do it versus the commercial technologies that are available for lots of reasons. And so what, as we go into 2025, I am very excited about agentics. I'm very excited about this knowledge graph concept and the ability for us to personalise experiences across the organisation for everybody. But also I'm very bored by the fact that a lot of the organisations have got their head straight on their strategy. They're thinking about their governance. They're thinking about the suite of technologies they're going to use. They've realised it's not just one. We're very fortunate that in many most of those instances are unique offering puts us as a core technology for doing that. And I think they're now starting to understand how to capitalise on this. So we will achieve more in the long term than we could possibly believe even though we're slightly frustrated in the short term with this technology. And do you see any particular challenges that are still arising, obviously, have had to overcome the challenge of just the general excitement of AI, what do I do with it? Any other challenges that you see sort of coming? Yeah, the one that slightly keeps me awake at night is the devolved responsibility, where at the very beginning it was the C-suite garing. Yes, yes, yes, yes, let's go, let's go. And now they're kind of, oh well, I'm done with that yet. And they've got to stick with this because this isn't a quick flick of switch and it's done. And this isn't a, oh, it's a techie project to give it to the IT team. This has to remain, if you want to capitalise on the opportunity, this has to remain as a board level agenda item because it's not just about what are we using the technology to do. It's about how we're enabling our people, how we're controlling our data and our governance to make sure we keep the C-suite out of jail that it's not leaking off somewhere. We don't want it to go accidentally. So there's a whole plethora of things we need to do. And then the opportunity for the C-suite is, well, how can I rebuild my business? If you're a CEO, if you sat down with a clean piece of paper and said, well, how would I build this business if Henry Ford hadn't set up the organisation structure when he did? How would my business look? This is the opportunity you've got to build the business, how you would design it, not how Henry Ford created the organisation structures all those years ago. And I guess it's moving away from just thinking about it. Oh, it's a digital transformation, it's a digital transformation. It's a business transformation with aspects like GNI, automation, data, as part of that transformation. And you get that clear, then that goes on for years and years. This is a long-term strategy of business transformation. This is not just a one-hit and I'm done. Oh, I can't tell you the number of customers I'm talking to, and this epiphany they have of what hang on. So rather than us talking to you every six or nine months and seeing what you're doing, we need to talk with you every three months. We need to look at what you're releasing, because the product is coming out so fast, and we need to say within 90 days, what are we deploying in the next 90 days, with one eye on what you're delivering in the next, the following 90 days, or with ROI's, so that we're in this constant, virtuous cycle of being agile in how we adopt the technology, as opposed to, right, well, this year I think we're going to use A, B and C, right? It's a 90-day cycle you've got to be in to really capitalise and move as quick as the technology is. I think a key point you just said is how we use a technology, and you mentioned in a previous episode about digital skills, that's going to be a big thing as well next year, and it's not just about hiring as many prompt engineers as you can possibly find. This is about training people to be able to augment their roles by having that understanding, that critical thinking and analysis of what AI is serving them, not necessarily needing the programming skills, and I think that's something we're going to see massively next year, is that kind of understanding of what are the digital skills that my employees need, and how can I provide that to them? Yeah, and we saw this so many years ago, there was, and it's still ongoing, this concept of a citizen developer, right? And it was this battle between IT and business, where IT's saying citizen developer bad, business saying citizen developer good, because business want flexibility, IT want control of the data. And I think in most organisations, we've got to a happy balance between that. If you get it right, you can protect the data and give the citizens the freedom and flexibility, and actually enhance the developer community for IT without formal trained developers. Now exactly the same as true with AI in my view, in that we want our employees to be conversant, to be comfortable, to be competent in using the technology, but what we don't want them to do is go off and do dumb things. And that's where I think as an organisation, you have to say, well what level of knowledge do I want to skill people up to? Yes, I'm going to have LLM engineers, and I'm going to have machine learning engineers, and PhD scientists in my IT group, brilliant, you need them. But equally, I've got an army of thousands of people, who if I teach them to use the technology, how the right way, I can unleash huge amounts of potential. Huge amounts of potential. But also using those people to help educate, so looking at it from a bottom up as well, it's all well and good as being, yes, it's a sea level, a sea suite level strategy, but the day-to-day users of it, they can source and find those processes that need automated. They can find those use cases to share up and say, do you know what, this actually could save me this amount of my time. Imagine if we scaled it across the entire business. Yeah, no, and that's where I think, when you're running, you know, to my mind, I mean, many years I've been doing digital transformations, it climbs. One of the things I talk about is what's your ideation strategy? Right, because ideation doesn't come from one person, or from a boardroom, or from IT. The best ideation comes from the people who are doing the challenges and solving the tasks, the people on the front line. So how do you bring them into your ideation? How do you not have the suggestion box that gets emptied into the waste basket once a quarter? How do you have a process of ideation that embraces them when they see change happening driven by their ideas and their understanding of the technology, then your ideation comes within the business, then you're really changing the business, how it needs to change, steered by the executives clearly, because you don't want to go off course, but that's how you really capitalize on the power of the people that you've got. Free their brains up, take away the man done a mundane and routine, take away the things they don't need to be doing. These ultra-process tasks, right? We talk about ultra-process food, take away the ultra-process tasks, give nourishment-rich opportunities to work on, and you'll see them thrive. And so important, that's my last question, and it's something that's come up in the podcast, is this multi-generational workforce. So this is not just about giving it to your younger generations coming in to say, oh, I can just AI that, I can build an app for that. We've got multi-generational workforce, we've got people living a lot longer, and they can provide just as much of the idea and the input into this as anybody in any teenager. There's so much value for everybody here, because if I'm new into the workforce, how do I become skilled? It used to be, I sit next to somebody, I listen to them, I ask some questions, and eventually I'm, and we talk about ramp times, right? Fast you can get somebody to ramp to value. We can ramp people very, very, very quickly with this technology. We can make the average performers as good as the best performers by sharing the knowledge of the best performers with the average performers, right? So you can transform that, and me as an older worker in the workforce, shall we say? Somebody's been doing us a long time. I'm so excited because I can see the opportunity for me to influence what we do as a company, internally, not just what I do for the company, but how the company works. And I think it's really opportune for everybody to get on top of this. Give you a personal example, my wife is an artist. She is a power user of GPT and perplexity, right? Which I would never have said six months ago, she doesn't use a browser anymore, she uses this technology, and she's not a formally trained in technology at all. But that's the opportunity, if you get this right, people embracing it. And she says, wow, I can do this. And, oh, I've done this today on it, and it's amazing. So yes, everybody can capitalize on it, and don't be afraid of it. Have a go, have a try. And that's really, really, really important. But we as businesses need to put the governance, the controls, the process around, to drive the innovation, to make sure we protect ourselves, and then you can unleash, unleash the potential of your company. And that's where I think that's what really does excite me. Well, I think your excitement has just come across, and I hope all the listeners can really feel your passion. So going into next year and trying these things out, seeing these future trends coming, I think it's a fascinating time. And thank you so much, Adam, for joining us today. Absolutely pleasure.

Episode 9 - AI Search (Gerard D)

00:26",313.0,20240416,569.0,," Gerard, really great to have you today. I'm excited about this subject because we're going to get a little bit deep and nerdy. What is it, my friend? Great question. Thanks for having me, Chad. Yes. Semantic search is a way of getting information to your end users. We often hear in the field, where are you using semantic search? Are you using semantic search? The answer is we are using it, we're using it in now assist. It's a way to allow for fuzzier matching and getting information to end users. This might be a great parlay to the second question. How does it work and maybe why does it matter? Here it is. How it works. This is where we get nerdy. This is where we start talking numbers. So basically the way that it works is we have something called a semantic encoder. These semantic encoders basically take words in this case in English and translate them into numbers. People often call the things that store semantic vector databases because you're basically building out a vector for your content or your search query. We're basically doing matching on the question that's being asked and the content that we have are trying to figure out how similar they are. Why matters is because we have a lot of customers that ask questions that are very similar in meaning to specific types of information but do not exactly match from a keyword perspective. So when you think of can I get access to outlook or can I request access to outlook? You need to understand that get and request are very similar in meaning and provide that as a response. There are some gaps in that but we can talk about that a little bit later. All right. All right. So with that in your experience because you've been doing this a lot with customers in the field what my success look like for our customers. Yeah. In this case, this idea of having a semantically similar content success looks like our end customers not needing to perform a lot of heavy lift on editing their knowledge base articles or their catalog items and really having a more natural experience with the content without needing to do a lot of tuning and tweaking. So what we've seen in the field is that when we've offered these semantic capabilities as part of now assist, there is an uplift of roughly 5% on our recall scale which doesn't sound like a lot I know but it actually is when you consider you know the thousands upon thousands of requests that customers get per day. At 5% to your point, 5% doesn't sound like a lot but this ends up increasing exponentially. So I got a final question by the way. You mentioned gaps. So what is on the roadmap for this? Yeah. The biggest issue you can say with semantic technology is that we're using an encoder like I mentioned earlier. There are some words that the encoder just doesn't know. So it just makes up a number for that term. So you may have, and it does the same thing for acronyms too. So you may have business specific terms or acronyms are using and we're basically going to match or have strange matches on those. So in the roadmap, we're combining our sort of legacy keyword approach which includes a lot of the synonyms and business specific terms or even company specific terms that can be configured by customers and combining that with semantic technology. So what end users will end up getting is the best of both worlds and a unified sort of representation of what that looks like. That is awesome. We only have four minutes and four questions. I know you want to get a little bit deeper. We have an opportunity. If there's any questions, concerns, want to get a little bit deeper, please reach out to Gerard myself in community. You will see the URL at the end of this. And with that Gerard, I want to thank you for spending your time with me. This was awesome. All right. Thanks, Deb."

You will learn how various observability AI agents can interact to solve specific use cases. Reach out to us i",784.0,20250227,479.0,," Hello everyone, welcome to a KBDI podcast. We are reviewing a new set of topics and you will see a lot of focus on agentic AI starting this year. So, as you probably know, service now is very deep into the three pillars that comes to work for the fabric that combines all data from different discourses, all your infrastructure and other data sources. Then we combine it into creating action with AI agents and then creating assisted and autonomous workflow. So, as service now unravels this whole space, we will be bringing you with new topics around this. Today, I have an expert in observability and Denika Shae joins us from San Francisco. Hi, Denika. Who are you? Hi, I'm Good. Who are you? Yeah, good, good. So, this is going to be one of the first topics in this space or first episode we're going to talk about. We're going to zoom into the observability world and what does the AI agents mean for that. So with that, before we actually dive in, Denika, why don't you quickly introduce yourself? Hi, yeah, hey everyone. I am Danica. I am a product director in the AI ops team and I lead a bunch of initiatives within AI ops. One of them is building AI agents. That's awesome. Yes. I, that's a great plug actually. This observability is a part of a broader AI ops solution as well. So both AI ops and observability go ahead and end. So we're going to get into both of those things a little bit more today and a lot more in the future. So, as we dive in, Denika, why don't you start with actually telling your perspective or what you think, when you think of a gent dig, when you think of AI agents, what comes to you, what your mind when you think about this space? I think for me, it's mostly like from a pragmatic sense, it's the access to information. So AI agents make access to information, access to complicated information much easier for any persona, right? I think with the rise of AI and LLMs, what the most powerful things about them is that you don't really need to be taking a class or taking a course or being in that data storage system to be able to get this information and understand it. The AI agent with the right access and with the right powers can get that for you and then also summarize it in a way that makes the most sense because it can understand how to explain it to different types of personas. So I think that's to me one of the most powerful but also pragmatic ways to use AI. Yeah, that's interesting. Of course, it makes, if you look at our customer landscape, it makes a lot of sense because a lot of our customers come from this operations or service desk environment, right? So they have different L1, L2, L3 types of responsibilities and depending on their level, they will be dealing with information, as you said, in a very different way or different or different complexities of information is getting to them. So AI agents can help them decide for them or simplify them for you for them. Okay, that's great. So let's get into a little bit of the world that we live in and that is IT operations. And tell us a little bit about how do these agent AI or AI agents will help specifically enhance this IT operations role. Yeah, of course. So the AI agents that I'm building within ITAM are AI agents that collaborate autonomously with third party AI agents from best of breed observability platforms. And so the problem that we're trying to solve is that when an IT operator is trying to triage and investigate an alert, they really need to understand very quickly what is the impact and severity of this alert and which teams and subject matter experts can they pull in to start the investigation. And the complexity is that the critical information to answer these two questions resides in information silos. It resides within service now. But it also most elusively it resides in third party observability tools. And to make the problem worse, these IT operators, they don't often have access to these tools. And when they do the learning curve for these tools is very high, right? They're not built for IT operators with more limited technical knowledge. And so with AI agents, you can sort of like break the barrier of access, first of all, because these AI agents can automatically contact a lot of these best of breed tools. And they can also simplify the information and present it in a way that's very operator-friendly. And so with access to the information, understanding and context of the information, they can very quickly understand impact and severity as well as get enough like nuggets of knowledge to start the investigation with the subject matter experts. Yeah, so I mean, this is great because a lot of times when we talking to customers, they just don't have one, two or three tools. They've had sometimes half a dozen or even sometimes it doesn't tools, right? And it opens more environment when you're monitoring your apps, your microservices, you probably have open source tools. So it just helps them, right? Because it becomes almost a manager of managers kind of approach for a lot of work. That's what ITOM does today. We embrace like an open system, open ecosystem of observability and monitoring vendors. We already connect with them via event management. They can now set, they can send events and alerts into ITOM. And from there, that's sort of the entry point for the IT operator. And our agentic approach is exactly the same, right? In the world of AI agents, we want to be the manager of the manager of AI agents. We want to be the agent of agents. And we want to help the IT operator connect all of these vendors and to be able to facilitate a collaboration amongst AI agents. And it doesn't really matter how the other agents, the other third party agents are built, right? I mean, they could be using their own LLMs, they could be using their own data structures. What matters is the data that comes to service now. Is that the right? Yeah, exactly. And I think also to add on to that, the information that they provide is very harmonious with the information that we already have. So we can take the information that they have based off of like triceps, logs and metrics and combine that harmoniously with the information that we have within the CMDB and sort of like the workflows and post mortems and like previous incidents and alerts. And we can marry that together and give the operator sort of like the best suggestion on what the next step should be. Yeah, there's also this brings up a good topic you mentioned, CMDB. So CMDB is a great way for becoming a providing a system of record for a lot of enterprises today. But even if you don't have a great CMDB today or you're still in the process of building a quality CMDB, this approach can still work, right? I mean, they don't have to be bound down to say that, you know, I need to get my CMDB like 70% to ready state. Exactly. It's pretty much decoupled. Yeah. And I think I mentioned this very briefly in the beginning that whole data strategy the service now has around work for data fabric and the RAPRIDB, which is kind of pretty advanced way of processing your data. That also helps because, you know, we are not bound to a specific data structure or a specific format. It could be able to format. It could be done in a any way that we can ingest that information into service now. So then we also call it a knowledge graph, which is kind of another way of thinking about how the relationships are built. So that's great. Let's go a little bit into, do you want to give us specific scenario? You know, you are working right now in the middle of this huge development and we will see that our development being released in the coming months. But if you take a specific use case, do you want to walk down a specific use case with what you're building with some of the other agents? Yeah. And so, yeah, and I think it always helps to anchor around a very concrete use case. And so the one that, you know, we see a lot, when we work with a lot of e-commerce companies, enterprise companies is that for example, the alert that comes into I-TOM will first be, say, on a application service called the payment service. And so it's the operator's job to sort of understand when they see this alert for the payment service. Say it's like the SLA for availability is breached, right? Normally, it should be 95%. It's now 94%. And so the operator really, in a world without AI agents, they need to figure out what's the impact and severity of the alert and who to pull in to start the investigation. And so with AI agents, now the operator can open, now assist. And automatically, we can detect that, okay, this alert is from vendor XYZ. But given we have an integration with them, our AI agents will just autonomously reach out to their AI agents to say, hey, can you tell us more about the alert? What other entities are you seeing being impacted? Do you have supporting metrics to sort of like support that claim? Do you see any things that might have caused that change? Recent deploys, configuration changes. And this is all information that we can get in real time to help this operator figure out. So, can I snooze or do I really need to go deeper into this investigation for the payment service? Yeah, I think that's a great use case because that comes up a lot, right? In our customers who are doing real time transactions. And they need to make sure that there's no anomalies. Or they can stay ahead of a little bit of anomalies that's coming up. It's a lot of rich data that's out there. But also, talk a little bit about this goes back to more of an AI ops kind of workflow to write. Once we get all this rich data, we're able to free-ogit. We're able to present it to a customer in a more, this could be an element of autonomous aspect versus assisted aspect. Can you talk a little bit about where does autonomous or of AI agents could come in versus assisted? Yeah, I think we want to give that control to the customers themselves. So you can see this in sort of like different layers of autonomy. The first layer, maybe the most conservative, is that the AI agent is just presenting a recommendation. So it's not really acting on it, but it's giving the operator enough information to say, hey, this is what, this is my guidance, kind of take it or leave it. But as we get more complex and integrated with actions that either agents can take on behalf of the user, the user can also in their configuration, set it to something less conservative. So not only is the AI agent telling them what is the rationale for next steps, it's also implementing those next steps. And you can see the most liberal would be it's acting on your behalf and it's just giving you a conclusion of what it did in the last sort of day or two. And so with the first release, we definitely want to tread carefully. We know AI agents are new, people are cautious, there's fears of hallucination. We really just want to summarize and give them the rationale for what is the conclusion that has been made. And then as we launch more, more and more agents, we feel a lot more comfortable in age two or 2026, we can sort of ladder up those capabilities. Awesome. Yeah, that makes sense. All right. So as we get towards the end of this podcast, how are customers can keep up to date and even if they want to get involved in this new developments, what can they do? Yeah, I would say that we are, you know, we have blogs, we have updates from the sort of normal service now channel as we're rolling out more and more AI agents across all of the use, not just AI ops and item. And definitely if you are interested in being a design partner, we would love to work with you to sort of figure out what is your use case and how we can build AI agents to solve your problems, reduce MTTR in your behalf. Awesome. This was just a kind of very snippet, small snippet of what we're working on. And we're going to bring you more of these kind of episodes that you can get up to speed on. Also you can go to servicenow.com. Our main page is loaded with not a lot of new use cases that we are working on. You'll get you up to speed. And Danika, thank you for being here today and we're going to get you back here soon when you have some agents out there working for our customers. But yeah, thanks a lot for being here. Thanks for everyone for listening in until the next episode. Bye for now. Thank you."

Within our podcast we speak to some of the industry's most exciting innovators, thought leaders and senior executives, all with the aim of giving you, our listeners, the inspiration, insights and market intelligence you need to help drive your organisation forward. This week we're speaking to Gina Gill, the Chief Strategy Officer for the Cabinet Officers Central Digital and Data Office. Welcome Gina. Thank you very much, I'm delighted to be here. Now in this role that you've been in for a few months, you are focusing on the new government's digital strategy and delivering of transformation. I was really keen and interested in what you were saying about building the strategy, the building the foundation sorry for this digital future for government. In your view what's critical to the foundations that you're building? So I think that relates to the reason that I moved to the centre in the first place. So there were two reasons that I moved. The first was I couldn't see where we were going as government digital and data. So I couldn't see the vision that brings us all together. We're over 20,000 people working across many different government departments and then if you add health and local authority into that, then that number gets much, much, bigger. And I couldn't get a sense of what we're collectively trying to do. So I felt like we were building some great digital services and isolation, but actually not necessarily solving that end-to-end user experience across different departments, across different services, across different agencies. So that was reason number one, having that clarity of where we're going. And then number two was things that we have called system reform, I hate the name, but it's things that slow down or prevent digital delivery within departments. So if you speak to a hundred colleagues, the list, the kind of same things that are frustrating. And those are things that I think the centre is best placed to resolve and has to resolve. And it's things like money and incentives, so how we fund digital work, which isn't really aligned to digital delivery and it doesn't help us to deliver in our way. It is much more aligned to kind of big infrastructure, not technology infrastructure, but big infrastructure projects and programs and big waterfall programs. So that's an issue for people. Incentives, I think, is the other thing. So I don't think we incentivise departments to work together. So how do we, how might we resolve that? So if you're having some interest in conversations with Treasury about that and thinking about things we might be able to do in that space. And related to that is, you know, we talk about efficiency a lot, but again, we don't, we talk about efficiency within kind of a department or an agency's budget, not across the system. And lots of, and I think lots of the efficiency that we need to create is across the system. So, you know, think about justice. The cost of recidivism is 18 billion pounds a year. That doesn't sit in an individual department's budget, right? That's the cost to UK PLC. How do you get after that? How do you create the incentives to get after that? So that's money and incentives. The second area from the US capability. And I don't mean capability within digital and data colleagues. I think, you know, we've been, we've made, we've made quite a lot of really good inroads into that. But more broadly, I think there's still a lack of understanding of what digital means across the civil service and across senior leaders in the civil service. I think we still see it as a back office function. We still see it as a cost space. And we don't really see it as frontline delivery. And a lot of it is now frontline delivery. And so there's something about how do we change? How do we help to help people to like, better understand digital and how it can enable a different way of delivering services. And then last but not least is, is how we buy things and work with industry? We're still very, and we've got lots of different frameworks. We did G-Clide. But we still predominantly work with the same really big suppliers. We don't, we haven't done as well as we would have wanted to. I don't think in terms of working with smaller, with like SMEs with smaller suppliers, with people who might have new and innovative technologies that might help to build better experiences. And I think there's a real opportunity in that space as well. And a real opportunity to think about how do we go from innovate? Like how do we go from kind of testing things to then actually kind of full on delivery without running, you know, many, many procurement processes, lengthy procurement processes along the way? Definitely. So it sounds like part of your strategy when the initial stage is going to be a bit of an internal change management piece. Like so that kind of cultural mindset shift to thinking about how digital can align a lot of these different government departments. I think that shares service, the interoperability between all the pieces really needs to come together to overcome some of the legacy technology and the silos that exist. Is that going to be part of your strategy that you're trying to do? So it would definitely be part of the strategy. And I mean, what we're talking about is cultural change, right? And cultural change across an organisation a system that has been in place for a very long time. So that's not fast and it's not easy. But I think we have to say a really clear picture of where we're going. We have to say I kind of what the next kind of three to five years will hold. And then we have to talk about those kind of foundational pieces and what we're going to do to address those over that period as well. So with the new government encouraging the notion of doing more with less and using technology to improve efficiency, there is a real need to not just build that longer term digital strategy that is robust, but remain agile and respond to the political, the economical and technological changes that are inevitable and that are happening as we speak. Yep, look at it's hard. It's hard and it's hard in a system where we know that every five or so years we'll have a potentially a new government in a different direction. So I think we need to separate where we're going long term and set out a clear long term vision. And that has to be something that is hard to argue with. And so I think it has to be grounded in service and public service. And I think it has to be grounded in the user experience that we wanted to create for members of the public and for businesses. And so that could be things like that could be things like we don't want people to have to share their data, same data with us all for an over again. It could be things like we want interactions to be simpler, we want interactions to be seamless, we don't want people to need to understand which department they're interacting with or which service or form they need. So I think you can set up that picture of if this is what we want it to look and feel like in the future. And then work with each government to look at how you prioritize which services you focus on during that particular period. So for this government, for example, it might be planning. So aligned to the mission for growth. So I think it's yes, set out the long term that's hard to argue with the kind of transcends and political parties and elections and then use kind of each new term to focus on the priorities of the government at the time. It's a really difficult balance isn't there between the people that you're working with and how to make that shift and change in government to really what citizens expect. They've got apps, they're all using TikTok, they are digital first, digital natives and they've got lots of ideas and they don't want to sit on a phone anymore. They don't want to talk to a virtual agent anymore, sorry, a call center agent anymore. So in your view, what technology do you think is needed to try and get that balance with a milestone so you're going to sort of build it. So I'm actually trying not to think about technology because I think that I think technology changes so quickly that we're in danger of saying, we're in danger of setting out a strategy that says, yeah, we're going to use this particular technology to reach this goal. I think we really need to focus on outcomes and I worry that in the past, we kind of go through phases of different buzzwords and when I first landed in governments, it was RPA. So robotic process automation. I was a reddit, a strategy I was at meeting a few months ago where they were talking about robots and I genuinely thought they meant physical robots until I realized they meant they didn't mean physical robots at all, we were talking about robotic automation. As you know, over the past, Euro say AI is the word on everyone's lips and I think that if we get too caught up in the technology, we end up implementing technology for technologies sake, potentially putting lipstick on a peg and not actually solving the problems that we set out to solve. When Jenny I burst onto the scene, I was at the MOJ at the time and I would get people emailing me from that I had never met before in your organization. I've got a great idea here. I think we should do this in many eye perspective. We can do AI prison visits. I don't even understand what that means. So I think we have to really make sure that people get excited about the problem that they're solving and not about the technology. I completely agree. I had a fantastic conversation with Sally Ann Hick, she's the global VP of automation experience and she's a huge advocate focusing on the business outcomes first, the challenges that you're trying and naturally AI might not always be the natural answer to the question. There is a journey, there's an evolution of what you're trying to achieve based on what those challenges are. And speaking of challenges and the foundation you're trying to put in place, do you see re-skilling and upskilling and the general digital skills piece has a challenge or a bit of an opportunity with your team and your department? I think it's an opportunity and I think look the excitement. So the one thing that AI has done is it opened the door to many conversations that we weren't having before, which is a good thing. And I think that that helps us then to have conversations about skills. And you know, when we last spoke, I talked about the fact that that doesn't mean that we need to turn everyone into a techie for a format. I think it's much more about having the skills to be able to operate in a digital age, which really is an age of change, constant change. And so it's about being able to work with people with different skill sets. It's about being able to really focus on what is the problem that we're trying to solve and what is the experience of the user that's using the service. It's much more about the ability to think, naturally, to solve problems. And the desire to understand how other people are solving problems, I think, and kind of trying to bring some of that back into government is that clear? There's a lot more just to skills. It's more about the digital literacy. How do you interpret the data? How do you? I mean, I've seen job roles advertised for AI prompters. So people are actually working out what do I need to prompt AI to get the information out? And actually, that's a skill in itself. And I think we have to not ignore the human intelligence that goes with the artificial intelligence. And there is a skill to that. There's a skill to being the human in the loop to make sure that you're using the technology in the right way. Absolutely. And there's an interesting debate about, actually, do we end up with human skills that are actrifying because we're replacing them with technology? So people lose the ability to bring that human lens and how to keep the right balance in that. And I think, I mean, CDDO has been working on a framework for where AI shouldn't be used or how to think about where to use AI particularly generative AI. And we had the same kind of linked at the Ministry of Justice. And it was, in some cases, it was specific to different business areas. So, for example, in courts, it's an absolute red line in terms of technology making judgments that's just not a line we're willing to cross. And therefore, it's, I guess, relatively easy in that space to say, this is where the line is. I think it's actually harder in other spaces to say this is where the line is. But those are the conversations we need to be having. Yeah. I think it's introduced, touched there on a little bit of almost like a bit of a digital divide and not losing the sort of the human skills that we have if we rely solely on technology that actually you could see you know, they talk about things like AI and technology being able to bring that digital divide together. But there's also an opportunity to challenge there with a bit of a fear that it could expand that divide because you know, like we all use the calculator and I'm terrible at mentor we don't want to lose the abilities that we have just because we then become solely reliant on technology. Absolutely. Absolutely. I think that's a real progress, definitely. I think another area that's interesting with the sort of the human and the artificial intelligence is the sort of the bias around AI. I don't know if you've seen the latest TV advert with Dove and we haven't actually, it's really powerful because they sort of type in to the sort of chat, but you know, give me a photo of a beautiful woman and so of course it generates what it thinks is a beautiful woman and then you know, you can put in the information, give me an image of what is a dove beautiful woman and that's when you get back the images and their different sizes, different colours and it's it's it's suddenly becomes more representative and I think there is there is a fear there on what that bias is you know, if we don't put it in the right date and especially for you, I think with that customer first mentality and looking at your citizen experience you have to get that data right. You don't want to put anything bias into your systems because you're then going to be getting the right user experience out. Absolutely agree, but I also think that there is there is so much data that sits across government that is it's subjective, like because so again going back to the Moj like case notes and I say just damage in health at doctor's case notes so that there's lots of that type of information in data that sits in government and there's and you need to that information and that information will likely have some level of bias in it because you know as humans we all have a level of bias. So it's about how do you how do you make sure that you're not amplifying that bias and I think I think that's hard and I think we only find that by by experimenting safely but experimenting to see what level of kind of accuracy we get when we test AI in different scenarios and then we have to make decisions on whether that level of accuracy is good enough and whether it's good enough for public service particularly. Definitely, I think that's where AI has a very positive force is it's creating this curiosity there's such curiosity about what we can do with technology and I think that's possibly the biggest opportunity that that it has given a lot of a lot of us at the moment. Yeah, the other thing that I um I went to speak to some policy people of my old job and they said come and come and speak to us do you know about AI? I'm sorry, I can't come and speak to about AI but I'll speak to that as well I think and and they asked the question of how do you how do you think um but what impact should you think this will have on on the way that we work and for me it was an opportunity to say actually I think that you know we should be sat side by side and building this technology I mean we should be doing that anyway with with technology but particularly with with Jenny AI where you are testing and retesting and kind of fine-tuning the technology I think it brings operational colleagues policy colleagues digital colleagues closely together and I think that that can really be a good thing definitely and do you think it's made are you talking about sort of legacy technology and sort of government technology government departments have been around for a long time do you think it's enabled sort of the younger generation to look at your role to look at what you're doing and actually see it as quite more exciting than perhaps they used to and you're sort of seeing that sort of a sort of interest in getting these new digital skills and joining your workforce. That's an interesting question I don't know you know I I think that what do I think I think that when people look at government they still have an image of what that's like in or civil service and they still have an image of what that's like and so I think it's hard for people to kind of connect to that and imagine and see themselves in those roles and so I I think where um the thing that is more likely to influence people is where we are talking to people and they can see where normal human beings and actually and and and we're grappling with some quite interesting problems that that for me that for me is more powerful than any kind of individual technology and getting people excited about these types of roles. Definitely. Well, no, and you're a perfect face for it. I mean you talk so eloquently and yeah it's quite inspiring to hear about your vision.

15,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_PVU9hJTh8,Episode Eleven: Experian - Putting AI and automation to work ,Episode Eleven: Experian - Putting AI and automation to work,ServiceNow Community,Unlocking the full potential of AI and automation is no longer about streamlining tasks — it's about reimagining entire processes. That’s why global information services company Experian is transformi,705.0,20240626,119.0,," Welcome to today's ServiceNow UK and I executive serve the podcast. I'm delighted to be joined by Sally and Hicks, the global vice president of automation at Experian. Hi, thank you for having me. So Sally, I think we have to start with what does a global vice president of automation do and why is it so pertinent to a company like Experian? So that's a great question and I think when I joined the organization, people thought I would be looking for pockets of automation, you know, for pockets of things that we could automate on a task level basis, but we really developed that role and that capability into something far wider reaching that covers really the end to end of everything experience doing. We're looking at how we accelerate value, how we bring, you know, our value points with our customers earlier in the in the journey. We're looking at how we generate efficiencies across our delivery organizations. And we're looking at automation opportunities throughout those throughout those value points really. So can we put it in a good example? Obviously we will probably use experience to check our credit scores. How does automation, you know, what's it been doing to support that experience from an end user perspective? So there's B2C, which is where, you know, we know our credit scores and then there's the B2B business, which is all about delivering great software to our customers. So, you know, what does that mean and who are our customers? So the software we deliver essentially sits within three pillars. We've got decisioning software, we've got analytics software and we've got identity and fraud software. Our customers are lenders, so people who are lending money to us as consumers. So traditionally that was the banks, you know, the Barclays and Santander's. But, you know, as things move forwards in the world that we all know, actually the lenders, you know, are, you know, in healthcare, in automotive, in buy now, pay later. You know, when we're buying online, we see Klan and pop up, you know, there's this lending going on behind all of those things. And so our software solutions are to support the lenders in those journeys with their customers. So working out, you know, if you can have a mortgage, how much you can borrow if you're telling the truth, you know, are you who you say you are? You know, you know, are you, are you, are you honest and honorable? And what kind of analytics do those businesses need to look at all of the data, you know, about us as a, as a poppy. And what kind of departments do you find are coming to you more with a, can you automate this? Can you automate that? So, I mean, where do the requests come from? So we sit within the global business. So our regions in our organization, deliver that software to their customers. We're about enabling them. So we need to make sure that we can deliver our world class software as fast as possible, that we enable those regional delivery teams to be as efficient as possible. So it's, how do we get the software out there? How do we enable everything to do with the software in the most automated way that's possible? So we talk about a vision for one click on boarding for our customers. And we talk about those delivery organizations being able to focus on the things that matter most, which is their customer experience and being able to focus on the things where they can add value as humans and not be, you know, focused on repeat tasks. And things that can be done for people so that they can, you know, value add a lot of those, those things you just talked about the value that it provides are often things spoken about in regards to generative AI. Where does automation finish and end or does it not and where does generative AI so I wouldn't think of them as either beginning or ending. I think of probably things more in layers. So, and back to, you know, when I joined the organization and people probably thinking that I would come here and automate tasks. So, you know, would you need to send those emails that you sent today or could something do that for you, you know, would you need to create that report or someone could someone do that for you. But actually what I do is look at the end to end. So, if I take the example of on boarding a new client, the end to end is the journey from when a customer decides to buy our software from us to the day that they're up and running on that software. And that involves things like building the solution, designing it, you know, configuring it, testing it, giving the customer access to the solution, you know, different customers access to different elements of the solution based on their their persona and creating, you know, secure transport access so that they can share files with us and things like that, all of those things. And so, there's a process involved with that, right? Well, I take away from that is it's not just, you know, like we use chat to you, we put in some information that we want to turn something out, you're weaving it in as part of that end and process. As I said, as a layer, and I think what I really took from that was really interesting is that you've got to have that what am I trying to do with it first, what is that problem, what is that outlook that I'm trying to achieve and then how does it woven in to get to that right outcome. Exactly. And I think a lot of people think of generous of ideas and we can just plug in and it's going to do something. But if you don't know what you want to achieve, you're not really going to get what you want out of it. So what do you recommend to other businesses and other leaders in your position who are saying, look, where do I start? So I think don't start thinking I need to do generative AI. You need to know what your problems are. You need to know the problems you're trying to solve and you need to have decided what your what your vision is, what good looks like. Yeah. So, you know, and most business leaders will know this right, you know, they'll have, you know, some fairly clear views about the problems that they face, the challenges and what they want their delivery to look like, what they want their organization, their service offerings, you know, whether it's a product or services organization, they will know where they're trying to go, they will have a vision and a strategy. And, you know, they should know the things that are wrong in the organization at a macro level, if not a micro level, so the things that aren't happening. And, you know, it's that that they need to dig into further to find the things that actually they want to automate to make more repeatable to have just happen automatically so that people within the organization can, as I say, focus on value. I think, you know, every leader will know that within their organization, actually, there's a lot of waste, if they're honest with themselves, you know, in any organization, probably over 100 people, there could be 20 to 30% waste. And, and by that, I mean, tasks that people are doing that are ultimately not adding value to the bottom line. And, you know, that happens because nothing stays the same, you know, we're all always changing and adapting. But, yet, people's jobs do not change and adapt as quickly as the environment around us. And, if they don't adapt, then essentially what you could be doing is doing something that isn't required anymore. And, some people are smart and figure that out and stop doing it themselves. But, oftentimes, most people at the grassroots have to be told, don't do that anymore. And so it's our job as leaders and visionaries to figure out what the new thing looks like, what the new target operating model is, and to stop all of the things that we used to do that we don't need to do anymore. And, an automation and generative AI will be a value to us when we figure out that thing. But, we've kind of got to figure out that first. Yeah. And then we automate the things that we need to carry on doing. And, we use generative AI to help us create them more efficiently. And, I think, a really particular word you used in that answer was people. And, obviously, that you're saying, taking them on that journey, some people come to that realization how they can do things differently, others don't. How do you go about in an organization that change, that sort of change transformation? I mean, businesses have been on a digital transformation journey for a long time. This is just another evolution. But, how do you bring them on that journey? So, I think openness is really important. And, allowing everyone on your organization to see and understand your vision, your strategy, and your view of what good looks like and where you're going is really important. I think that most people's struggle with adapting to change is when they don't understand that. But, if you can take your time to tell and show people where you're going, then actually every human has the ability to understand that certain things need to change. So, that's the most important thing. And, that's every layer of the organization. You know, no strategy can be created in a boardroom and executed without, you know, that cascading all the way down through the organization. It sounds obvious, right? I'm, you know, probably preaching to the converted, but everything we do has to drive that culture of, you know, change and understanding of knowledge of the strategy of sharing. It has to be, you know, throughout what we do. It's an imprint of everything we do. So, what's the queen of automation? If there was one thing in your life, even outside of work that you could automate, what would it be? But, you know, I've had a really painful experience recently with my, with my pension. So, I've been doing probably what many people will, will have gone through, which is to transfer, you know, a company pension part with a previous organization into my, into my new company. It's a terrible process, you know, I had to fill in some online forms, digital forms to say I wanted to go through this process. Excellent, I think. This whole thing is going to be managed digitally. No, it doesn't work like that. So, they send me a pack of about 20 A4 pages, right? And 12 of those pages are forms for me to fill in and return, but I'm not told how I need to submit my forms. I'm not given an envelope to submit my forms. And I'm not told whether I need to get them back from my new provider and send them in one go, or whether I need to send them separately. I just, just ludicrous, it gets worse than this because when I haven't filled them in because I'm going through a process of figuring out what to fill in, I get sent a second pack. Hey, Sally, you wanted to, to, to transfer your pension. You don't seem to have responded to the first pack we send you. So, here's another pack. I start sending the forms back, which I'm told I can send back by taking a photo of with my phone or scanning an email, like back into the digital world, back into the digital world, and I see it there looking at this, knowing exactly what I would do if I was on the other side of the fence. It's an end to end thing, right? And if you look at this process, you can see what's happened because they haven't looked at the end to end. So, they've given me an online form to fill in to say, hey, I want to do this. But then there's not really all this paperwork. And you probably couldn't even find an envelope after all that either to send anything. Exactly, and I'm going to have to buy a stamp for you know. Well, this has been enlightening, Sally, in the world of automation. And thank you so much for joining us today. It's been pleasure. Thank you for having me. It's been a pleasure."

I've been doing ServiceNow a long time. It's something I'm really passionate about. This is a topic that I really love. I would almost consider Service Operations to be part of my ServiceNow Superhero Origin story. So I originally worked in Operations. That's where my background is. And I was always a bit kind of jealous about the ServiceGuys because they seemed to be able to affect more change into an organization and I was able to at the operations level. And so I switched to do more service-related things. And I found out that actually the ServiceGuys were a bit kind of jealous of the OperationsGuys because they had all the data and the insight. Really, we were operating independently and not delivering the value we should have done. So I think Service Operations, there's a lot of names for it. There's a lot of parts of it. But that kind of combination of those two worlds is something that I'm passionate about because I think it really delivers value for customers. And I really like that Kerry is really about connecting the silos of processes, building ITAs, ITSM, and IT Operation coming together. I thought Telco could be really a complex market and industry and the customers probably using the lens of Telco. What are most frequent questions and requests are getting from your clients? Yeah, Telco is interesting because it's obviously one of the largest most complicated areas in terms of the number of assets, the importance of the service to people. People expect it to be on and running all of the time. We are very much used to it almost as a utility. And so that complexity, those challenges bring a real focus on the importance of service operations and being able to manage high volumes of changes and complexities in these environments and keeping the resilience of the service high as well. So I think Telco is a really interesting area. Yeah, it's truly about customer experience as well. We've a good service operation and good at customer experience. I couldn't imagine the day that I would be dropped off from the network. Now, Kerry, how is Fajusu approaching the service operation uniquely in the market? Yeah, we have a lot of insight into a lot of industries and we, that visibility across lots of industries and areas means that we are able to learn from how we're implementing on one customer and take it to another customer. And dealing with that complexity as a service provider ourselves really gives us some real insight into the way customer organizations operate often will go into a customer and talk to them about their operations and they will say, oh, yeah, we're unique. We're different. Our operation is totally different from everybody else's. But actually, they're not always that different as they think they are. You know, there's just really good, good hygiene and good service operations practices that they can be applying. And the way it apply to our own organizations that they can pick up and adopt regardless of the uniqueness of your industry. Right. That is so true. And then I have to bring up the next question. It seems like we can go on, you know, a minute without talking about AI, right? It was the top of my for your customers as prospect certainly comes to AI service operations coming together. Yeah. So obviously, Gen AI is the big topic at the moment, right? Everyone's talking different chat GPT and kind of things. Those kinds of technologies have really opened up the AI conversation. And customers always a bit as surprised to know that there's they could be applying AI in their item and IT operations already. They think that Gen AI is a new thing. And like this is really cutting edge. And actually the principles of applying machine learning for your event management and you know correlating all your events and things like that are actually really not new technologies, right? There's things that been around for a while and you know, using AI in that context is actually a relatively easy step when you've got everything in the platform like service now. So I think customers are really surprised and excited and really pleased that they can accelerate their journey with AI without having to learn kind of a load of new complex AI tools. You know, it's all there ready for them to use. And to carry out to lead a group of your insights that are that's all AI matters. I was sharing a lot of the customers, the data machine learning using that will probably based on medical statistical model. That's from probably 50 hundred years ago. So, really, yeah. Yeah. And I mean, this whole excitement around Gen AI or all the skill sets that it brings us to human was just wondering, you know, where your composition is really evolving around where how are we going to start off our AI journey? Yeah. The whole AI journey, it's obviously difficult for customers always to know where to where to start, right? So, yeah, we could be applying AI at the service end. We could be applying it at the operations. And I always think that you need to start from where you are, try to automate as much as possible. And then if AI helps you to automate, then even better, right? So stick with stick with kind of first principles, look at the operations, content, the data, what events have you got coming in? Look at your service tickets, what's the, what's hot in terms of service outages and events? And then look to try and apply automation as much as possible. And just follow those good principles. And at some point you'll go, we could do this better with AI or we could, we could completely get rid of this bit of work for our people by having it automated by an AI. And at that point, that's the obviously the point where you need to start considering it, but you don't have to consider it from day one, right? No. It's really about turning to become from a firefighter, to be more proactive, predictive, you've been management, you're talking about, and probably about skilling operations as well, I think this way, AI and journey, I come to send it. Absolutely, yeah. I just want to pivot the questions a little bit, I think we started talking about telcos. What other industries are you working with to apply service operations today? There's lots of industries where service operations can and should be important, you know, more than you think. We've mentioned on telco just because of the size and complexity, but you start to see IT operations being applied in all sorts of industries, you know, you could take, for example, manufacturing and utilities, and also obviously the operational technology side as well. So we talked about, we're talking about IT, really, in most cases, but we've now got the capability to merge the IT and OT worlds together and apply the great principles that we already apply to our IT assets and our IT operations to our OT operations as well. So I think that's a really interesting, exciting area. And we have lots of customer conversations where they're really interested in the principle of bringing those two things together and managing them together and the same with security operations as well. So it's a gateway into really good security operations. So every industry is really interested in their security, you know, cybersecurity is big on the agenda. And so as a gateway into that conversation, you know, IT operations is right there at the front of everyone's mind. Yeah, definitely. I think we're definitely seeing more attacks, not just on IT systems, but also on all TV devices, the cameras, you know, the production's machinery as well. Yeah, everything's connected now. So we've got to worry about it. Yeah. So the conversion of IT and OT's really become really real for your customers. Absolutely, yes. Yeah. And industries where you wouldn't have thought that traditionally they didn't need to worry about it, right? Yeah. But now you see the sort of cybersecurity attacks on the news. Suddenly, it's right at the top of, you know, the CGOs, you know, the C-suite are really interested in it. And so it's coming up in conversation lots more. And it was really connected to us. It's not a game of software and a hardware suppose or the devices that are, you know, you being used by, for example, industry like manufacturing utilities, that use a lot. Could you share like, like, probably, you know, possible examples of manufacturing customers that you work with and then how they have benefited from it? Service operations? Yeah. So for manufacturing customers, particularly, down time is obviously a big issue for them, right? Production line is not running, then you're losing money straight away. And there's a high level of sensitivity from, you know, factory floor managers. They have traditionally been very kind of resistant to the IT guys coming in and messing with their stuff, right? Because the factory floor teams are obviously incentivized to keep the factory floor running all the time. And they don't want to hand over any control. But you can start to see when you introduce service operations and you bring those factory floor managers into the fold. And you could, they can understand how they could reduce their down time or improve their productivity by playing the principles of IT operations and service operations. Then you can get them on board, right? They're interested, suddenly, as long as they can have the visibility through, you know, work spaces and things like that, then they're all on board. Yeah, and this is how traditionally, like business departments being organized IT and then SOOT departments, often silos. And this is where I think service now comes from, a service operation, about connecting the people, the systems as well as the processes. What are the misconceptions that organization have for the approaching service operations that you're sending in your clients on the market? One of the things we seek quite often is organizations seeing some concept, like, say DevOps. And they say, okay, we're going to be a DevOps organization. And I say to them, where are you with your service operations? How far are you with your ITOM journey? And they go, oh, we've not implemented that yet. And I say to them, we need to get some basic principles going here, right? So let's look at your data model. Let's look at the consistency of the data. Let's make sure that you've got good practices happening in your organization, because you don't want to layer on a technology change and a organizational change like DevOps at the same time. You're actually taking on far too much. So let's get your service operations, your automation and improvement in what you've got today. Then let's transform your organization to be a DevOps model later. So just take things slowly implement based on sort of simple principles. Let's try and simplify, let's try and automate, let's try and optimize. And then let's look at the DevOps or SRE or something like that in terms of your organization. Definitely, I think this is really about setting that whole foundation and we are talking about having really good CMDB and laying one top-down building blocks. Absolutely. Yeah, really about the default process by self-claiming for some of the years. It's like, you know, problems are a lot for j's and God knows why it's coming around the corner. And really need to have that visibility and also the actionable insights around our browns at. Yeah, what do you think we're hitting next when it comes to service ops? Yeah, I think there'll always be this need to optimize and automate as much as possible. We've obviously talked about AI. I think we're only just learning where all the use cases are for AI. So we've been doing some interesting things, for example, at FJTC with visual AI. So that will analyze pictures and then have those feed into a service operations type landscape. And so I think there's technologies like that that people haven't really considered properly, but which could provide some real benefits to their organization. So I think those things are exciting things. They're new areas that we're opening up the eyes of customers to see. And I think that's probably more and more of those kind of AI related concepts are going to happen. And there's more and more things go to the cloud. Obviously cloud operations is becomes a much more important thing. I think we'll continue to see more maturity in that area and more importance of managing your cloud assets alongside everything else. Those things are going to be the things that people are worrying about for the next few years. I'm not sure about just the next few years, probably the next decade that it probably is talking about. Carrie, I mean, has there been a great conversation, but just kind of like wanting to end of anything else you want to add, especially for our clients, will all prospects of really about studying off their journey. Any advice, what a gift there. Yeah, I say don't be afraid and start simple, right? Look at those foundational principles, you know, organizations like fidgetes who come in and help you get it right from the start, rather than learning by making them stakes and having to go backwards and fix things. So yeah, come and come and talk to a partner, try and get that conversation going, use their knowledge of previous implementations to make sure that your implementation goes well. Thank you so much for joining us today and also for us to be a great partner as well as a customer of service now. This has been really a great conversation. Yeah, thank you very much for having me. It's been really good. And thank you to all of our listeners. Please subscribe and share if you like what you heard today and be sure for joining us for the next episode."

See how you can intelligently summarize product feedback and automatica",1817.0,20250331,333.0,," Hello and welcome to SPM Academy. I'm Deborah McGrath, Principal Product Marketing Engineer with ServiceNow and SPM Academy Host. Joining us today were thrilled to have James Ramsey, Director of Outbound Product Management, to discuss and demo how serviceNow can help you realize the potential of AI with SPM and our AI capabilities. You're going to hear about how it all works, why it's important, and then see it in action in James demo. Then we'll wrap up by sharing some resources and some really important upcoming events. So James has a ton to cover today, so let me quickly point out our safe harbor notice and then I'll turn it over to James. Well, most of what we'll be discussing and showing our features that are currently available, there may be forward-looking statements that reflect the current beliefs of serviceNow based on current information available. Your actual results may differ materially and should not be relied upon in making purchasing decisions. So with that, I'd like to welcome James. Help us all become a little smarter today about AI. Thank you, Deborah. Hi, everybody. I'm James Ramsey, part of the Outbound Product Management team for strategic portfolio management. So in today's session, what I thought we'd do, we'd start out in looking into the strategic portfolio management and it's rolling, helping organizations and helping you optimize the value of AI as you roll it out of a cushion organization. And this is looking at AI in the larger picture, whether that's AI on the serviceNow platform or whether you're using AI on Google, Microsoft, et cetera. How can you deliver that across your organization? Then we're going to look specifically at how we're putting AI to work with inside strategic portfolio management. And I'll give you a short demonstration around some of the capabilities we've delivered out the box and you'll find within size does undo at least. And just before we go, I'm going to try and get five minutes to give you a sneak peek of what's coming just around the corner with a Yoke Harmer at least. So with that, let's get cracking. So everybody's talking about AI. Everybody's looking to deliver an AI strategy across their organization. And rightly so because AI is promising to solve all those complexity issues as we're looking to drive change and innovation right the way across the enterprise. And that's backed up by lots of different independent surveys where we're seeing lots of executives seeing the transformation effect there. So GNI I will have through 2027. But if you think about 2024 was potentially in most organizations did their to into AI and how it could be applied across their organization. Move fast forward into 2025. And it's all about how can we ensure we're getting a return on investment. We're going to deliver substantive value on our AI investment. So for that we need to ensure that AI lives up to the hype it delivers on its promises. But the fact of the matter is looking at various different organizations and certainly organizations I've talked with over the last 12, 80 months. A lot feel they're not really prepared in terms of how they go about rolling out and adopting AI successfully across the organization. And without successful adoption, you're not going to get that return on investment. And part of the problem there is the actual framework organizations are looking to put in place in order to deliver AI across the organization. How it allows them to roll it out. But also how it allows it to track, govern and ensure we're not exposed to risks. So what we're going to look at first of all is SPM's rolling ensuring we get the value from delivering AI. Now we think about the building block you need to be successful in delivering your AI strategy where you need to have a vision. What are we looking to achieve and one of the targets where we're going to look to put in place in order to measure success? We need them to identify all those AI use cases that we want to roll out across the business. We want to bring them together, we need to objectively assess them, prioritize them, and then from that move forward in terms of planning out what that AI transformation roadmap looks like. And then looking in terms of how we deliver all those initiatives. As we're doing that, we've got to link in with our enterprise architecture disciplines. We need to understand where AI is being deployed across the organization so that we can ensure we monitor any risks and we always stay compliant. And ultimately, as we go through this end-to-end process, we've got to ensure we're optimizing the value that AI is providing. We need to be understanding what the value is being delivered. And if we need to pivot plans, we need to be able to do that. Now, if you think about those five steps, it all screams the need for strategic portfolio management. And that's because an AI transformation is just like any other transformation or strategic initiative that goes across your organization. And we know the importance of having a strategic portfolio management approach in the successful delivery of those strategic initiatives. So through capabilities like the strategic planning workspace, which we'll see later on, the ability to define what those priorities are, the then-to-roam map our AI strategy, and then track how we're actually delivering on those priorities and the value being created all through SPM. And we all know through SPM, we can deliver working lots of different ways, whether it's traditional projects, agile work. But if you think about an AI perspective, lots of things happen very quickly. Lots of little experiments may be happening in terms of different AI technologies being tested out across the organization before we do a full roll out. These experiments are typically driven by AI incubation teams. And that's a perfect use case for collaborative work management, which is a new capability we introduced in strategic portfolio management. The ability to build, bring those incubation teams together very quickly, to plan out what we need to do inside the experiment, and also to expose that experiment onto our roadmap and any dependencies it may have in things we want to deliver in the future. And finally, with that link between SPM and enterprise architecture, we have that ability then to map and model how we're looking to utilize AI across the organization, both in our current state and our future state models. By tying together enterprise architectures to strategic planning, we're able then to have a better view of our risk posture and ensure that we're going to achieve compliance. So that was just quick insight in terms of the importance of applying an SPM approach to enable you to maximize the value of your AI strategy as you want to deliver it. Now we're going to look at how we're putting AI to work within strategic portfolio management. Now one of the key elements and one of the key strengths of service to our strategic portfolio management is it underpins the end-to-end lifestyle from strategy through strategic planning, portfolio planning all the way through to delivery and ultimately value realization. And through that end-to-end process, there's some key stakeholders that engage in utilising strategic portfolio management from business leaders through PMO to project resource managers development teams, etc. What we're looking to do by applying now assist to the end-to-end SPM life cycle is to enable each one of those key personas to gain benefit through AI to make them more productive to help them make better decisions and ultimately to fast track value through that end-to-end lifestyle. Now you may have seen similar diagrams in the past. This is something I used to depict our end-to-end cycle on how we looked at transform our strategy into delivering value, whether it's related to the business or is related to technology from strategic planning to portfolio planning to that delivery of work. Now, what we've done through the Zanadir release is look to apply AI across that end-to-end life cycle and provide some specific use cases for those key personas as we look across into our life cycle from business leaders all the way through to project managers and development teams. So whether it's looking at how we get more demand from across the organisation through compositional demand, whether it's helping our product managers or quickly assess the feedback or it's helping those various teams collaborate and be more effective in managing their documentation with some of our documentation. So lots of different use cases already there sanded out the box. Now, what I thought we'd do at this point, let's call out a PowerPoint. And we're going to actually go and look in terms of what that looks like within the solution. But this is my Zanadir release. And first of all, I've come to the floor you portal because I've got a new demand that I want to submit. And rather than me going through and clicking on a form and filling in a form, what I can do is actually engage with now assist directly. And I can say I have the demand. And what now assist is going to do is look for all the different types of submissions I might want to make and across an organisation you may define lots of different types of requests that can be made. So I can see here I've got a number of things which as I might under create demand or maybe something specific around HR content I want to add to our training syllabus, I might have some generic types of work requests I want to make. Well, let's say I'm going to look at creating a demand I can start that request. And rather than me being presented with a form, what now assist is going to do is ask me a series of questions. So it's going to take the user through the demand and ask him all the things that are pertinent to that type of request. So let's say we want to do auto categorisation or product feedback. And as I enter my information, now assist will then look at why do we need that? The new product managers to react faster. And I'm taking through those various questions. I can even have things that as I'm adding in my request I'm going to align this to the various key strategic initiatives. So this is aligned to customer centric product innovation. I'm going to say this is probably going to be of medium level effort. And then what I'll do just for time today, I'm going to skip some of the non-mandatory questions around cost and around benefits. And then what now assist will provide me with is a summary of what I've entered in terms of asking those questions. Now I've made a mistake there, in terms of the level of effort. So I can say I want to make a change. And in natural language I can say change size to large. So now assist will go away and make that change. So we can see in terms of the level of effort that's now changed to large. I'm happy with that. I'm going to submit it. And that's the demand now in my demand pipeline. So that enables us to get everybody across the organization participating in that demand intake process because it's making it easier for people to use. Now if I'm a product manager, I can be in a strategic planning workspace and using our feedback capability. And one of the things I do on a day-to-day basis, I get lots of emails from customers around feedback around our product. So in product feedback, this is giving me visibility around the products I'm looking after in my business customer portal. I can see the categories of feedback I've received where that feedback has come from. I've even got things like sentiment analysis to look at. Now everybody's talking about AI and how we get AI into products. So I can drill down into that section. I can look at all the AI related feedback. And if you think about the typical whirlwind today, I'd have to look at all of those emails individual, go in, read them, then assess them and decide what I want to do. A very time-consuming process. What I can do here, I can quickly look at selecting all the feedback items I'm looking at. I can click on my Summary's button. And what now a system will now do is do a summary of all of those feedback items, bring me back a bulleted list of the things I need to know about. And immediately then I can put that information from now assist into action. So I can link it to a product idea or I could click demand directly or an epic or a project or whatever it is and drive forward an action that's information from now assist. If we move forward into the process, let's look in terms of enterprise agile planning. Now throughout that into process, you will see on the slide actual previously the ability to add AI in the context of documents. So right the way across, to do portfolio management, we've introduced what we call the docs tab. So this is enterprise agile planning. I'm looking at the agile work from my business customer portal team and I can see all the epics currently being worked on. As I drill into docs, I can see I've got a couple of documents there, one of which is release notes. As I drill into that document, this will give me information around what's in those release notes. And I can see I've been at message to actually shorten the introduction paragraph. And with docs, these are fully collaborative so other people can come in and collaborate around creating these documents and we can reference other information on the platform, like referencing records, et cetera. Now, what I could do, I could pick the paragraph up. I could look at now assist and I could click on short, summarize or elaborate. Or if I want to summarize the entire document, I can simply click on summarize and that will provide me a summary of the overall release notes document, which I can take that test and actually put in the document should I wish to do so. Now, docs is available right the way across SPM inside the project workspace, and inside the strategic planning workspace inside product feedback. And that use of AI is available right the way across. Now, the final use case we're going to look at now is something we rolled out in the November store release. It's called the project insights email. So if I'm a project manager working inside the project workspace and I'm looking at my project, I've got the ability to set up an email project summary. And what I can do here is set a schedule by which I want this summary to be created. And what will happen as that email is scheduled. Now, assist will then generate me the content relating to what's happening in the project. So just as an example, what I'm just going to do here is just bring up an example of what that email looks like. And we can see it's broken down into a series of sections. And what now assist will do is generate this format of email. And with inside each section we'll provide information and links to various elements of the project. Give me insight to what's happening with inside my project. Without me actually having to come into service now to understand what's going on. And should I want to action anything that the email is telling me? I've got the link. I'll take me back into the solution. So a very powerful way of providing proactive insight for project managers utilising now assist. Now let's go back to the PowerPoint. And what we're going to talk to now is what's coming, what's around the corner? And what I'm going to introduce now is something we're looking to roll out with inside your karma around AI agents. So very much where we've been in 2024 is around phase three of AI, around conversation or workload. And you saw through those examples that I showcase quickly there, where the human is actually engaging with now assist, asking now assist to perform actions in order to help that persona do their particular work. Now fast forward into 2025 and everybody's talking about a genty AI and the use of AI agents. This promises to be the most transformational thing to happen to the SPM life cycle for 30 years. And I've been working in SPM for all of that time. It's a really exciting prospect where we can have agents proactively working and helping facilitate personas right away across the end of the process. So what does that actually look like? So from an SPM standpoint, what we're looking to do is provide AI agents that are persona driven. So whether the target is towards an executive or portfolio owner or a project, a resource manager, we're effectively looking to create these agents to actually perform specific activities or to understand specific use cases. And what's exciting about them is you're effectively creating a system of agents. Those agents are going to work together as a team in order to help analyze activities, provide suggestions and recommendations to the personas, and then actually take action based on what the humans suggest needs to happen. Now if we look at what the structure of an AI agent looks like, I'm going to take you in a moment and give you a sneak peek of the AI agent studio. Now the structure is essentially we define a use case. What is the business problem or the activity we're looking to address? And we're going to provide some natural language description of what that looks like. What we'll then do is define a trigger of what will kick off agents looking at this particular use case. Now it could be user driven, but the power of AI agents is in that trigger beam machine driven. Something happening in the database, a record being created, a field being updated, an API call, whatever that may be. And from that trigger, that will kick into what we call the AI agent orchestrator. Now what the AI agent orchestrator will do will identify from that trigger if this particular use case irrelevant. And then from that will look then to trigger off the specific AI agents needed to actually work on solving that particular business problem. Now the AI agents themselves think about them as having specific jobs to do. And again, I'll show you an example in a moment. But what they'll do is one of them might be to collect information. One might be presenting information back to the persona. One might be to actually take an action like create a record or something like that. Now the key element of those AI agents as they're looking to do their tasks, their activities will be defined through a prompt. And then associated with those agents will be what we call tools. And these tools of what the agents will utilize to interact with information, whether it's now assist skills or whether it's scripts, as we do in a state business or using workflow, using things like Raguay, we're looking at different things with inside documentation. Those tools will be utilized by the agent to help and perform that task in order to help us solve that business problem. Now let's quickly jump in and see what that looks like. So now we're taking you into the AI agent studio. So as I say, this is now something we'll be rolled out with inside your carman. The examples I'm going to take you through now are just examples I've created as we've gone through. But sure, sort of the direction of travel that we're looking to do from an AI agents perspective within size strategic portfolio management. So the example I'm going to use is around application rationalization because this is one that's got a lot of people excited in various different industry sectors. The first step is we define our use case. So as I can see, one use case application rationalization using AI agents to automatically assist architects in rationalizing their business applications. So I drill into my use case. We've got a description of what the use case is. And we got some AI instructions in a basic prompt telling me what's going to happen here in terms of how this use case is going to happen. So it's going to be kicked off by an objective and objective. And then what we're going to ask it to do is identify the overall analysis of our business application portfolio to give us some cost information. The next step will be then to identify some candidates to help us meet those cost targets. And then on approval, we're going to create some demand records. Now the trigger we define in this case is just a simple bigger based on some information from a KPR and an OKR within size. SPM where we've got a changing target. So it's going to recognize that change in target, which will then kick off this particular use case. But as I say, that trigger can be any activity. And then you'll notice at the bottom here, we've got three agents that are related to activities that we're going to perform in this use case. So the first agent is to go away and find me that portfolio cost information. The next one will be to identify my rationalization candidates. And the third agent is all about taking action creating those demand records. So if you're looking in terms of say, let's take the cost analysis agent. Again, we describe what the agent is. We give a description of what the agent is for and what its expertise is. And then we provide a prompt in terms of what we're asking the agent to do. And how it's there to get its information and how it should be then presenting its information. So a simple prompt language. I'll add to that as I mentioned, we then provide a series of tools. In this case, I've got a single tool. This one is a script. But we can add different tools and they could be scripts. Now, it's the skills using retrieval augmented generation. IE for going information with this documentation or using workflow. IE, flow designer ticket, separate flow to support. So lots of different tools and you can have multiple tools supporting each of the agents. So from creating that structure, what you can then do is take it into testing. And that's what I'm just going to take you crossing into here. So prior to the session today, what I did was going to testing identified the use case we wanted to test. IE application rationalization. I gave it the instruction in terms of what I wanted to mimic. IE in this case, we're going to reduce the legacy spend for each application by 50%. And then I clicked on test. Inside the studio, then what happens is on the left hand side, you have a mimic of what you would see in the analysis panel from the information that the use case will provide. And as you can see, we can see at the top of the first agent that's gone through and it's provided me with that analysis of the cost information around our portfolio. So total cost of applications. What our new rationalization cost target actually means I reduced by 50%. The fact we've already got 8 milleens worth of savings are already identified. So it's telling me I need to find an extra 5 milleens worth of savings. What is then gone on to do that second agent is kicked in and identified a series of applications and provided information per application including the potential cost saving of that application. So identify what those candidates could be in order to help me reach that 5.3 million from a savings perspective. In fact, it's identified a potential 12.4. So from here, I can sort of engage with that response. And it's the other thing I should say, some of these are being identified as critical business systems. So we can see for example, our workday system is a critical business system. We probably don't need to get rid of that. So I can say remove critical business systems for example. So I can actually mimic what would happen inside the panel and the agency of kicking that central area will then show how the various agents are engaging with each other. So I can see how the orchestration is communicating with the different agents. And on the right hand side, I've got full visibility in terms of what's happened and the thought process that has gone on with the agents as they go through. So if I look at these various elements, it gives me a view of activities that have happened. And the things that it's been asked to do. And this is really useful in terms of how you create new agents. And as you're looking at how the agents are running, you can actually go through and identify how those agents work. So as you can see, AI agents are going to be a really powerful capability. And just to finish off my final slide. And just to let you know as part of what we're looking to do with inside your car, or subject to safe over will be our first AI agent. That will be around project testimonial tree. So an agent aimed at the project manager. And it will look to provide a project manager with insight to what's happening with inside their project. And summarise information around the project task, their resources and milestones, as things happen within inside the project. So if you're thinking in terms of the great step forward, we made with the project insights, email summary that we're releasing November, the AI agent will take that to the next level by providing this. Inside as things happen and notify the project manager. So look out for that as part of what we've ended deliver in your car. So with that Deborah, I'm going to hand back to you. Thank you James. That was absolutely awesome. I do feel smarter and definitely more excited about all these great AI capabilities. We do have a few events and resources to share that were a real fine to help all. First of all, on March 13th and 14th, we're thrilled to once again offer our Bionuel SPM vision series. You'll experience discussions and demos from our team at service now and customers like you.

See",564.0,20230725,8669.0,," Hi, this is Evans from the Technical Product and Solutions Marketing Team at ServiceNow. Today, we're going to talk about ServiceNow IT Operations Management, specifically AIOPS and Event Management. AIOPS, or Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations, is the practice of using AI to assist and help automate the work of IT operations. Using AI fundamentals like machine learning and pattern recognition, ServiceNow's AIOPS solution provides much needed help for today's operations teams. And thanks to multi-platform integration, ITOM Event Management puts all the important events, logs, and metrics teams need to do their jobs right at their fingertips. Today, Amelia Bryant from the IT Operations Team is troubleshooting an issue with a critical service related to her company's customer payment portal. She's logged in and working with the Service Operations workspace, ExpressList. ExpressList enables teams to quickly triage and resolve issues. Issues that are otherwise hard to spot in unstructured and out of context metrics, logs, and events. This design is great for people like Amelia who prefer an enhanced view when working with alerts so they can stay focused and stay in the moment. It can filter on things such as alert severity, configuration item, assignment group, and so forth. Being able to add or remove fields from the filter view gives teams the flexibility to customize the workspace for maximum efficiency. Amelia's team is also leveraging alert tags, which are generated by extracting keys from additional information in events. Created and event field mapping, these tags can be used to further correlate alerts to reduce noise. You can see they've set up a filter so they can sort by data center location tags, since team members are responsible for different areas. Once created and saved, custom filters can be shared so others on the team can quickly get on the same page. Alerts can also be filtered by impacted service. Today, Amelia only cares about the payment gateway service, so she can quickly narrow her view to only show those alerts. Public actions can be performed on one or more alerts or groups of alerts. Amelia can act on all the alerts related to payment gateway in just a few clicks. And most importantly, this can all be done from a single page within the service operations workspace. All alerts associated with payment processing have been consolidated into two group alerts. Configuration items with different sources and metrics have been grouped together based on the learned pattern item event management has discovered. Patterns are formed based on repetitions of the same alerts coming together repeatedly in multiple time windows. Using this analysis, event management concludes that these alerts are related. Other alerts from different monitoring tools are oftentimes symptoms of the issue and not necessarily the cause. Only focusing on these kinds of alerts is a very reactive way to troubleshoot and resolve issues. You can see that the second group alert came in long before the critical alert where the service went down. That's because this group alert includes alerts from HealthLog Analytics or HLA, a major component of service now AI ops. By analyzing trends in anomalies and logs, HealthLog Analytics provides an early warning system about problems to come. These first warning alerts show how HLA caught the problem first, allowing Amelia and team time to be proactive and to help prevent future failures. In this alert, we can see that there's an increase in logs associated with IIS, which is the web hosting environment for the Payment Gateway service. From this alert, Amelia sees that there's a sharp increase in the volume of logs associated with the web host. And thanks to HLA, she can see that 90% of the logs contain warning messages, a true sign of trouble. Sharing this kind of insight from logs can be a very manual and time-consuming process without proper AI ops tools. Changes to any associated configuration item are tracked through the ITSM Change Management workflows, and as a result, they can be referenced here. Sharing information like this between teams and workflows is a key aspect of the service now service operations approach. In this case, it looks like a DevOps orchestration task might have caused an unintended issue with the Payment Gateway service. Thanks to what she's been able to quickly determine using the service operations workspace, Amelia now has a clear idea of the root cause and can work with the DevOps team to resolve. So far, we've seen how ITAM Event Management can combine alerts from multiple sources, which help speed up and streamline troubleshooting efforts. We've also explored a little bit about the benefits of HealthWog Analytics. But you may be asking yourself, how did Amelia and the team configure those connections with other data sources in the first place? Or what types of integrations does ServiceNow support? The new integrations launch pad provides an in-context intuitive way to configure such connections. Amelia can either search for a data source she wants to add or filter by connection type. She simply selects on one of the out-of-box integrations to configure and then follows the wizard. Setting up a new out-of-box integration can be done in just a few steps. First she'll enter a name and then set up any custom tags. Tags allow for better filtering and can be used in the express list view like we saw earlier, as well as other dashboards within IT Operations Management. So she'll go ahead and add the location tag that she and the team have been using. Before activating, Amelia copies the URL she will need to pair the integration from the AWS side. And after doing so, Amelia and the team can then interact with AWS alerts along with all other sources from within the ITAM event management system. She can even set up a custom connection in case what she's looking for is not listed, or she has a homegrown application that she would like to incorporate into event management. Today Amelia is going to go ahead and set up a connection with the team's new PingDum Monitoring System. Just like with the out-of-box setup, she has the same option to add custom tags. Using tags in this way has many benefits, including better visibility and better understanding of business context when working with alerts and outages. Adding custom images makes it easy to visually identify connections within a large set. When setting up custom integrations, field mapping helps reconcile various fields from other sources with the ones used by ServiceNow. To begin this process, Amelia paced JSON code she's copied from PingDum. Certain mandatory fields must be configured at a minimum. Amelia finishes up by configuring any additional field mappings needed based on what PingDum is providing as defined in the JSON snippet. And just like before, Amelia copies the URL that she needs to complete things from the PingDum side. And after doing that, the team will then be able to see PingDum alerts as well in ITAM event management. Integrations Launchpad provides the ability to check activity and work with the team's installed connections, including the ones Amelia just configured. Average logs per minute and last event received can be seen for all the installed connections right from this page. This lets Amelia make sure connections and data transmission is working as expected. And here's the new custom integration Amelia just set up. She wants to confirm success, so she'll go ahead and check here to see if ITAM alerts are being generated from PingDum, and also check to see if field mapping is working. Test alerts are being received and processed by ITAM event management as expected. The AI ops dashboard is where Amelia can really see the big picture and drill down into events and alerts, agent health or health log analytics. You can see they're getting great noise reduction and incident compression rates, thanks to ITAM event management. At the bottom you can see that the Windows IIS server, which is involved in the current payment gateway outage, has been producing a very high number of alerts. It's easy to see the status of ITAM agents as well to make sure everything is configured and functioning properly. And finally this page lets Amelia go into depth with health log analytics metrics. HLA Data Visualization helps operations teams track and analyze metrics. This provides a better understanding of what's happening with the many logs that are being gathered from many different sources. You've just seen how with the help of service now, IT operations teams can work and interact with the information they need in an intuitive and responsive way, all from a consolidated interactive workspace.

Part 2 of 2.,382.0,20220615,443.0,," Hi, this is Evans Nicholson from Technical Marketing at ServiceNow. Welcome to part two of the mini-series, AI-powered service operations starring ServiceNow, ITSM, and ITOM. At ServiceNow we understand the amount of data coming in and the complexity of today's hybrid cloud environments. We know many times lack of data and information is not the issue. AI-powered service operations enables the move away from an incident creation culture to more of an alert-based actionable mindset. This helps you find problems and solve them in a more predictive fashion versus being stuck in problem change and incident management. The key is being proactive versus reactive and having the right supporting system to be able to achieve that. In part one, we saw how an issue with a company's mission-critical internal ordering service was causing a flood of new tickets in our service engineers' queue. We then showed how, in parallel, the operations engineer was able to quickly determine probable root cause of the outage and trigger a service degradation. So let's pick the demo up from there. Nora Griffith is an employee who uses the order status application called Portia Online in her day-to-day work. She's having issues completing her work, and so she's going to check in and try to get some help. Remember even though she's using this from the ServiceNow web interface, she could also use Microsoft Teams, Skype, Facebook, Workplace, or other collaboration platforms. Let's just type in the summary of the issue, and thanks to the natural language understanding model, virtual agent can pick out keywords and phrases and suggest the right workflow. In this case, Nora's team has configured a set of additional questions to help troubleshoot the different areas related to the ordering system. Now Nora has confirmed that there is an issue with the order status process, which is used in the Portia Online service. She doesn't need to open up a new incident because she can already see that there's a ticket open. This is what we mean by deflection. Alerting employees that there's an ongoing issue helps stop the inflow of new tickets, allowing service operations teams to concentrate on troubleshooting and fixing the issue instead of managing more and more tickets. Now let's continue looking at things as Roberto Hopper, a member of Nora's IT Operations team. From operator workspace, we can see the order status service is in a critical state. As we saw in the previous video, related alerts have been grouped together by ITAM event management. Let's just go back into the group alert so we can continue troubleshooting as we look for a way to resolve the issue with the order status service. The first alert that came in was from HealthLog Analytics. This HLA alert is letting us know there are some anomalies with the logs, basically unusual patterns or something that happened recently that hasn't happened before. If I open up this option, we can do a deep dive into the logs. On the first line, we can see details on a suspect log associated with the Windows host X42. Opening up log viewer allows us to really dive deep into these logs and understand what we're seeing based on what was triggered by HLA. We can see more about pattern recognition, both out of the box and patterns that are learned over time, thanks to the machine learning of HealthLog Analytics. Now let's go back to the group alert. And speaking of machines recognizing patterns and helping us troubleshoot, let's click on probable root causes and we can see another example of this. Two recent changes are flagged as possible causes of the issue we're seeing with the order status service. The bottom one appears to be a schedule change by Roberto's dev ops team, but the top one is unauthorized, so let's take a look at that. Scrolling down, we can see that in this emergency change, someone has changed the sequel trace flag to true from false. This is very helpful when troubleshooting SQL, but sometimes this can cause disk space issues if you forget to turn it off because logs are much larger when this is enabled. There's one additional step we could perform to take a look at the logs, but in the essence of time I'm going to skip to Roberto's conclusion that disk space is filling on the SQL server, and that's what's causing a cascading effect to the order status service. Roberto is using all the information within these pages within the service now platform to reach this conclusion. Let's go back to the group alert and I'll show you how we can trigger the fix through flow designer directly from the service now platform. First, Roberto decides to bring up the agent assist function to look for helpful articles related to disk space. Here's one related to clearing logs on a Windows server. Seems appropriate, right? So let's attach that to the ticket. Roberto will put in a note about his findings giving some insight to the team into what he's thinking. Now let's open up actions so we can actually fix the issue. That's the whole point, right? We're trying to fix the problem. Now this is one of my favorite things about the service now platform in this scenario, in this case. With flow designer, we actually have the tools to reach out and fix issues on affected CIs, which is great. Without such functionality, we'd still have to manually remove logs, expand disk space, things like that. And clicking on the run remediation button, the platform actually has a prebuilt workflow to handle this situation. As I scroll down in the main group alert, you can see all of the associated alerts have been closed because the issue has been addressed. You can see we cleared out about two and a half gigs of space by running the remediation. And here's Roberto's note with the KB article attachment. Now let's go back to the operator workspace and check the status of the service. Order status is no longer in a critical state. We've just seen how service now can help IT teams solve complex issues. We can help identify if all events coming in are tied to a single problem with event correlation. We can find the root cause of the issue faster. We can notify employees of ongoing issues. And of course we can provide suggestions, but most importantly, remediation actions to fix problems. We've also seen how operations and service teams can work on the same data and the same system instead of working in silos. This moves organizations towards a more modern and cooperative approach, an approach we call service operations. For more information check out the main item product page. Thanks a lot and I hope to talk to you soon."

S",319.0,20250603,242.0,," Now Assist for App Engine enables businesses to unlock the full potential of their custom apps, providing seamless self-service, faster decision-making, and improved operational outcomes. In this demo, you'll see a few of the features available to now assist for App Engine customers. This solution empowers organizations to embed advanced generative AI and AI agent capabilities into custom applications built on the service now platform. SAM is an employee education program manager at Electrie. He's in the cross-training management workspace, a dedicated custom interface designed to streamline the administration of employee training at his company. In the past, it took hours of his time each week to track and manage all of the tasks related to organizing and booking cross-training sessions. But not anymore. Today, SAM wants to check on upcoming sessions to make sure employees get the training they want. To do this, he simply types in a request using the conversational interface of now Assist. It then chooses the Training Demand Prediction option. This triggers a customized, high-level coordinated workflow called a use case. Use cases invoke AI agents, which are entities that mimic human-like intelligence by using large language models. You can see the agents analyzing past enrollment data, reviewing employee skills to identify gaps, and reviewing upcoming projects. Up to this point, the agents have been working autonomously. Now they pause to ask for more information to proceed. This is called a supervised action. After reviewing the details that he was able to quickly receive from now Assist, SAM makes the decision to schedule cloud architecture training for 60 employees. And just like that, the session is added to the calendar. In the past, unexpected demand for certain topics resulted in a lack of available trainers leaving employees on a wait list. Cross-training is a top priority for SAM's company, Electric. And with the help of AI agents using both autonomous and supervised actions, SAM was able to predict training demand and seamlessly schedule accordingly. Now let's take a look under the hood and see how this all works. ServiceNow's AI agent studio enables you to create, manage, and test AI agents and use cases all in one place. So let's review the use case we just saw SAM utilize. Here, the business outcome that this use case targets is described. And this is where we add in one or more AI agents to help research and solve issues detailed to the use case. To create a great AI agent, the agent's role, its specialties, and the identification of the business problem is clearly defined. This is where you add in automation to equip your AI agent with various tools to accomplish its role. As you can see, there's a large selection to choose from depending on your needs and skill level. An important option to point out is the Now Assist skill. Using the Now Assist skill kit, you can build and deploy custom skills that leverage generative AI directly within your instance. These skills can serve to enable use cases that the current suite of Out of the Box Now Assist skills cannot as of today. In this case, the AI agent is designed so it can call a subflow and here we see the details. You can choose from Out of the Box options or make your own with tools such as Workflow Studio. Agent actions can be autonomous or supervised like we saw before and so this means you're always in control of how AI is used. Now let's get back to the use case details in AI agent studio. Triggers and the conditions for activating use cases can be defined. This trigger is configured to run when certain languages used in Now Assist prompts such as Suggest High Demand Training or Suggest Training. This is where we configure the display and access for a use case from within the conversational interface of the Now Assist panel. This makes it conveniently available to users like Sam as we saw earlier in the demo. In addition to testing and troubleshooting a new use case, this step can also be used to visualize what's happening in the background. When testing a use case, you can see the AI agent orchestrator and communicator working together to organize and manage the AI agents as a team. The orchestrator assigns individual specialized agents to complete the sub tasks. The communicator lets the orchestrator know the status of each agent and handles the end user prompts and replies. And finally the log section details interactions between the orchestrator, communicator and agents. You can download these logs to troubleshoot more extensively if you need to. And that's how companies like Electri use custom apps and AI agents to optimize business processes, resulting in more efficient operations and better employee productivity.

And finally, if you are here with us, that's a great opportunity for you to ask your questions. So feel free to use the Q&A panel in Zoom to ask your questions and we'll make sure to answer those as we go. The session today is organized with an overview of our product and then we're gonna spend most of the time working through an exercise, which is a bit of a demo of the product and guide you towards getting started with the product and then we'll save some time for Q&A. And today with us is a peksha to talk to us about task intelligence for ITSN, very, very exciting and now a peksha, I'll give it to you. So hello everyone. This is a picture they will from India. So I saw a couple of folks joining from India as well. So hello everyone, good evening and good morning to all the people joining from US and good afternoon for the European folks out there. So I'm the senior principal product manager with IT service management unit. And I take care of all the AI AML portfolio for ITSN code products here and with you to demo or take you through the task intelligence for ITSN as a first release, the release in third on third of hours. So when you hear task intelligence, I know most of you would think that what is this? Is it different from predictive intelligence? Is it just the name which is changing? Or it's really something changing at a line? So the good news is the task intelligence is quite different from predictive intelligence. That's the reason we are doing the sessions along with multiple customers and how the task intelligence is different. The complete way how we built task intelligence use cases out of the box for our customers, the way we think about these use cases is different. The task intelligence is a purpose built AI for business users. When I say that each and every word makes sense, what those meaning is that business users means it brings business outcome driven versus technology as well. It means that we don't say that I use classification for this. We say, okay, if we want to do incident categorization for all AI capabilities which we can use in task intelligence, the way we think about the use cases to do it different. Also the AI ML model which uses, if you use deep learning ML models, which gives better reasons based on our analysis which we did in house based on multiple clone customer data. That and it supports multiple languages, on text, attachment, and so on and so forth. It also comes with a task intelligence admin console user experience which helps business users. When I say business user, it means that the admin business users does not require to have the expert AI knowledge or they do not require to have a data scientist knowledge. They just require to have their own business knowledge and then task intelligence admin console will take care of working them through after each step and then deploy the model. I will definitely demo that part today. So that would be more clear. Apart from that, the biggest value add, it will bring to the existing customers of the artificial intelligence task intelligence support multi-field detection model. So you will see in my demo that I would be creating single model to detect multiple views on the incident. So it's very low on maintenance, it's high on performance, and it's very, very easy to configure. With all these benefits, I now go to the exercise. Next slide, please. You like it. So this is the demo script which are the exercise script which I would be taking you through. So consider the company where employees were not at all satisfied by the service performance. Now, the service just manager and realize this situation and go to their business leaders and add money to understand what should we do because this reduction and satisfaction if also due to the higher increase in the MTTR. So this admin and business analysis decide to use task intelligence to solve this issue. The task that we intelligence admin console provides, human-friendly interface to train as is deploy and monitor the model. So as I said earlier, this admin and business analyst who do not have very great knowledge of the AIML can also deploy the model which they require for their business in the production. Once they do that, they need to go to recommended actions framework to to certain configuration to show these recommendations on the service operations work. Once the service operations workspace starts doing the prediction, eventually what happened is it increased the agent's productivity hence reduces the MTTR and at the end, overall employees satisfaction score increased. Now you will see that hey, should do configuring something in task intelligence admin console, then going to recommend actions to take care of how it shows on UI is too much of configuration. You talk about simplicity, but looks like there are two frameworks which I need to go and then do something. The good news is we take care of task intelligence and the committed action configuration out to the world by auto-trained model on your production. What does that mean? To moment you download task intelligence for ITSM plugin on your production instance, it's auto-trained the model for assignment groups, configuration items and services on your data, provided you have the amount of data in your system. And then also it has an automatic configuration in the recommended actions shipped out of the box. So that just downloading of one plugin will start the prediction in background mode. When I say background mode, it doesn't mean that whenever an incident gets created, the prediction will happen, but it will not show on the UI. Because you definitely don't want to surprise your agents. And then let's admin know that okay, something is happening or you are allowing that. So with this auto-trained model, you will be able to start predicting in the background mode by just downloading the plugin. And how all these things works, now I'll take you through the demo. As I take you through the demo, I would like to answer Julian's question. So Julian asks that it looks similar to the predictive intelligence classification. What's the difference here? Third question Julian, I thank you that you are this question. As a set predictive intelligence require you to create three different models to predict three different fields. But in task intelligence, a single model will be applicable to predict these three fields. That's one. The second is it supports multiple languages, as well as it's very easy to consider. As you will go through, you will see the type of power UI experience it brings. The type of power it gives to the admin is very much. You do not require to have that technical knowledge to understand the precision, the recall, which is there in predictive intelligence to understand whether your model is working fine or not. In task intelligence, it's very plain simple English. So any business user who does not have AIML capability or understanding, can also deploy this model. So these are the two very big benefits which task intelligence brings with it. Okay. So if you are on Utah instance, so you have five, patch five and above or Vancoa instance, and you downloaded the task intelligence for IDSM plugin, you will see this task intelligence for IDSM in your file navigator. In the task intelligence for IDSM, you will see two subsections, a sub menu, one is setup and one is monitoring. So this is also one of the benefit which you get with the task intelligence that you can monitor how your model is working. So if you remember it just a couple of minutes before, I said that the auto training model will start with deploy your model in the background mode. So in the background mode, it will show you how it is actually performing without showing the recommendations on UI. So you can actually come here and say, okay, my model, it was five times agents has accepted the prediction. It means and 21 times it has not. How the prediction was replaced, how it is doing and all those things you can see here. Even in setup, we have certain matrices to give you a quick snapshot about your performance of the model, but that in monitoring, you can do a thorough analysis. Okay, so in the task intelligence for IDSM set up module, you will see out of the box, you will shift this model IDSM out of the box task intelligence solution. This is an empty model which we see out of the box so that the moment you download this product, login in production, this model runs and get trained on your own data so that it predicts the value based on your own data automatically. I will work it through what this is this, but for example, you do not want to say predict these three fields. You can always go to this template, which we shipped out of the box and created new model. Add your own fields which you want to predict and train access and deploy your model. Let me work you through what we shipped out of the box. So once you come here, you will see the model name. You will see the output table. It means that on what table I need to train the data. So my training data is out of the box, which we shipped this. The data should be false in per the closed and resolved incidents. And I want to train this data on my V. So I just want to train this data on last 12 months. What all fields I want to predict? So I want to predict the assignment group configuration item and service. Now what all fields I want to give us an input for predicting that. So my input table is incident and the input. Here is a description and short description. This is also one of the difference are existing customer can know that in existing predictive intelligence. We just need short description, whereas task intelligence given its deep learning and long text support models. The description field also can be sent as an input and we have seen in our testing. That combination of these two actually provides for better results. And then similar to predictive intelligence as somebody mentioned the number of records, which is required for you to train the model is 10,000. And I guess the customers who are know knowledgeable about AI ml know that these records is the number of records. The more the better, the merrier is always better for your model to get trained. So once we decide this, we can launch the training and see how it's working. So it shows that till today when I deployed this model. In your past data, which is last 12 months, it would have predicted 47,000 300 and five fields for you, which is a great number to tell how you would have helped your service this agent in entering the correct data into the system. Now we will see how the model is actually performing as of now. So we will see, okay, for this service, it's performing quite better because 75,000 percent of the time what model predicted is what agent has actually written. 25% it is deferred, which is okay. For assignment group, I see it's 50% percent. So I might want to go with just recommendation instead of what to fill. But as I see the service is doing far better, I can say that, okay, I don't want my agent to manually fill it. You can fill the service directly into the field. And configuration item is also what 4159. So still keep at it as recommendation. In case if you're not confident, for example, in case of configuration item that hey, I don't want to do any prediction on UI. I just say that hey, do only monitor only it means at the back end, it will predict, but it will not show anything on the UI. So let me show you all three for the exercise purpose that for service, we are doing bottom fill for assignment group, it's recommendation. And for configuration item because it's less than 50% I just want to monitor how I'm what are the performing over the time so that I can come here in future if it the performance improves. Now I can see when continue. It will give a quick snapshot about what all I have done and it will say deploy. Great, so I'm already deployed it. As I said, you do not need to go to recommended actions. As this out of the box rule has already mapped with the task intelligence room. So let me show you where it's taken up. So this is the resource generator of the recommendations of the action. And here I would say that I want to play these three things and here in the resource generator is somewhere where I have mapped this. Okay, till the time it comes, let me give you a live demo. So let me create an incident in the service operations workspace. So you will ask me that is service operations workspace is a mandatory for us to use task intelligence. I would say no, you can still go ahead and use our existing platform user experience with the task intelligence, but you would not be able to utilize the power of. How you want to show the recommendation. It means whether you want to show as a recommendation or auto spill and all these things only happens in service operations workspace. So I highly recommend strongly recommend that if you are willing to use task intelligence, you also use service operations workspace 3.0 and above. So here is where I have mapped for example, this con this generator type is mapped to this solution. So this solution on the task intelligence is pointing to this rule and then this rule is responsible to populate these on the service operations workspace and how service operation works. They show us let me work with this. So I'll say email not working. I will also say. The morning I the moment I tab out that's the beauty of service operations workspace which does not come with any other experience. The moment you tab out please note that you have not created the incident yet. It means that a service desk agent who is just typing in the short description and description. The moment he tab out to enter some other value, he will be shown these suggestions. Now I want to walk you through what all we have done and the preferences in the task intelligence admin console. So we said service auto populate it means that whatever is predicted. I want to auto populate it here again it's just that I want my agents to have a quick view and also save their time. So that's the reason I'm out of populating agents can always change it is the more configuration item as the performance was risen 50% I said hey don't predict. Just do the monitoring in the background mode so that I want to watch it over the time. So you don't see anything here yet and for the assignment group as it was 50% I said just recommend so just recommending below the field that according to the I am the assignment group should do perfect. It's up to the agent whether to honor this suggestion or override it. So these are the three things which you have predicted to task intelligence and in these three modes and also keys note that the incident is not a safe it means it's not yet created completely but I am well run in background and gave the suggestion so that even the incident creation process not just the triage process the incident creation process also become swift. It gets created with correct data so that the incident get categorized in a right format. That's it from my site from the discussion or for the developer I'm happy to answer any questions. Thank you very much we have somebody in the chat asking again if it's only available for service operations workspace so if you could repeat maybe what you said about words available. Sure so as I said service operations work face which strongly recommend that you use service operations work face if you would like to use task intelligence for ITSM because you would be able to use the complete power of both the products in service operations for faith you will be able to call task intelligence prediction even record creating an incident this beautiful power is not there in our native. native UI or the platform UI which you call one that difference the second difference is these these features where you want to show some as auto populate some as recommended these two is also not you not available in our native UI but predictions are available so whenever an incident gets saved it will get saved based on the predicted value from task intelligence but that's exactly similar to what predictive intelligence also does with the native your current UI so the beauty of tasks intelligence will definitely enhance the use service operations work face. Great thank you there are also a few questions around whether we could use that in sub production so if you want to answer that and as well I would like to pray to provide one best practice around that. Just to answer the question with that be available in sub production yes but subtraction auto training capability would not be available auto training capability keys the moment you download the plugin the model gets auto train on your own data this part is only available in the production but you can you can have this plugin on the sub broad train it manually see how it works and all that. Exactly right great the that's the one best practice I want to provide everybody here and we covered for it's the same for task intelligence for CSM it applies here to ITSM as well when you train your model in a sub broad environment really make sure that the data you have in your sub broad environment is refreshed is up to date is matching what you have in production otherwise you'll be training a model on on the other is not. Realistic and you would not get good results in when you move the model to production. Yeah a picture we have two more questions in the chat would this work with universal request. Great question so as of now this would work only with the incident but I would take that feedback back and see how quickly we can bring task intelligence on universal request in our own lab. Great thanks and another question came in which algorithms are used for prediction by TI. Sure so as of task intelligence uses enhanced classification in the backend so that's the reason we as you see we shipped our first use case which is the categorization of the incident form as of now but going forward we would like to bring other use cases such as showing similar kbs. Similar incidents also on that state intelligence but as of now for our first release in office we support this one use case. And there were a few questions again when which release was that supported so you mentioned you talk to give the patch version again. So task intelligence for ideas and can be downloaded for you to patch five and above and when go and service operations works for three dot o version would be required for task intelligence and the recommended actions which I demo it if the plugin name or the store app called advanced recommended actions for it sm. So by the way task intelligence do take care of downloading that but as a as a check I would recommend our customers to see that if they have also downloaded advanced to come reductions for it sm as well then they would be testing this complete end to end product in this abroad abroad. Anyway as like mentioned nilima has created an awesome start guide in our community forum to give you an idea about the versions all the roles are quiet and I would strongly suggest to go through that. Absolutely I just shared the link for for those of us who are with us nilima is helping us with the questions today and she's an expert in that field so really recommend reading that article on the community. Well I hope everybody enjoyed the content today thank you a picture and nilima for joining us today and we'll see you next time. Thank you thank you everyone."
