1,1_0,hey folk how you doing chris thanky here and id like to welcome you to this session where i plan to show you the greatest feature ive ever implemented in my entire life it only took me a couple hour im going to show it to you in probably about 10 minute and by the end of it you can implement it yourself because it is actually incredibly easy to do now that were in this new world of ai agent and llm in using our lowcode nocode flow designer so ill go ahead and well start by showing you the demo of just what it is and youll get to see why i think it is so incredible and cool so what were looking at right now is a portfolio record in service now we have project management were calling it service portfolio management a well but you have this idea of these portfolio then underneath these portfolio youre going to have thing like demand and project and issue and in those project youre going to have status report so it just this ton and ton of info and a customer comment they had said well,An AI Agent that knows everything about your Projects & Portfolios
1,1_1,and issue and in those project youre going to have status report so it just this ton and ton of info and a customer comment they had said well what could we do could you do something where my project manager come in on a monday and we wanted to know what they need to pay attention to and we put that in place and thats this portfolio we can review but then i wa thinking about it and it really wasnt that much of a step to just make it so that we could ask it anything and get any answer out of it so in this example ive added two new field to this form you could do this in any way you want to i just like thing easy so i added a question and an answer field in the form so what happens is when i type a question in here and then i hit my portfolio answer button it sends all the information not all the information it sends key information from the project the project status report any issue that have happened and it sends all of those to the llm and then i can basically ask it any question it,An AI Agent that knows everything about your Projects & Portfolios
1,1_2,project the project status report any issue that have happened and it sends all of those to the llm and then i can basically ask it any question it sort of turn it all into a gigantic retrieval augmented generation system so let see what that would look like in practice so now i gave that example that i mentioned where the customer want to know what should i pay attention to when i come in next week and what it doing again is it grabbing all the information it sending it to the llm the llm is processing and aggregating it using the context that we provided and it gone ahead and now it unright so it kind of given u information on each project it helped u understand where to direct our attention and can you imagine if you had to go down into each of these project and review all the status report and pull all this information out it would just be it would be crazy right it would take you forever but here weve done it in an instant now in this example i can see that our evaluation tool ha,An AI Agent that knows everything about your Projects & Portfolios
1,1_3,be it would be crazy right it would take you forever but here weve done it in an instant now in this example i can see that our evaluation tool ha encountered some licensing issue okay well im kind of curious whats going on with those so maybe ill ask it more so whats up with the licensing issue on the ebail tool project conversationally even with some misspelling it sending that information it interpreting it it aggregating it and now it pulled back because again it know whats in the status report right so it know whats in everything and we can pull this information out and i can see ah it been escalated over to beth in legal oh fantastic but you know what i wonder are we getting kind of dependent on legal i wonder how often are we having to escalate to legal how often are we doing it imagine you going to your analytics your reporting person and asking him this question and asking him to extract it here we just click a button and instantly we find out that actually thats the only,An AI Agent that knows everything about your Projects & Portfolios
1,1_4,person and asking him this question and asking him to extract it here we just click a button and instantly we find out that actually thats the only time weve had to do it so thats good weve had some licensing issue but really thats the only time weve had to escalate to legal so thats fantastic but these are just some example of question you can ask it anything you want about it should we consider consolidating any project i dont should we are there some project maybe that are behind or low roi that we should consider consolidating now im not going to trust the llm to answer this im not going to put an auto button and have the llm start doing this but it tell u where to look it tell u area where we can have some focus and you can see here weve got some now this is all demo data right so weve got some project with no potential return other one that maybe consolidated to the project manager it doe still stay down here because our llm is looking out for you right you definitely need to go,An AI Agent that knows everything about your Projects & Portfolios
1,1_5,one that maybe consolidated to the project manager it doe still stay down here because our llm is looking out for you right you definitely need to go and look at this yourself but now you know where to look and i can even put in something like you know list every project project the project manager manager and the plan start date in json format so not only can i get information can it help me understand why i need to look and it act a my sort of de facto reporting tool now i can even have it for that stuff for me so it can help me to extract that data in way that might be beneficial to me so amazing feature and again it only took me a couple hour to implement and so let look at how we do that now what i mentioned is that we have this portfolio record and it got project in it and it got all these different thing so what we need to do is we need to bring back information and data from these to give it to the llm so if you think about it in your mind we need to sort of create a big,An AI Agent that knows everything about your Projects & Portfolios
1,1_6,is we need to bring back information and data from these to give it to the llm so if you think about it in your mind we need to sort of create a big variable where were just gon na put all this data so that we can give it over the llm and the llm can do it processing now if i come down here and i look at one of these individual project youre gon na wan na youre gon na wan na sit down in your data youre gon na wan na look at your data youre gon na wan na look at what field are you using what field are you not using what field are you using inconsistently you know when youre looking at your data you might not be happy no one happy with their data there always something missing there never anything great what youre really looking for field that are used consistently and that especially or field that have free text to be entered so something like the business case thats a great field of process definitely if youre putting in financials you wan na try to bring those in so you could ask,An AI Agent that knows everything about your Projects & Portfolios
1,1_7,like the business case thats a great field of process definitely if youre putting in financials you wan na try to bring those in so you could ask question about financials but basically you wan na get an understanding of what are the field that are relevant on the project that you would wan na ask these question about and then you create a flow this is a subflow no coding is required basically what you do is you start with your input right and our input think about it were at that portfolio so our input is gon na be that portfolio thats the first input and then our output is gon na be this big gigantic string that i wa talking about so once we have our input and output you then go into a lookup record plural not singular lookup record so you look up your project record and you look those up where the portfolio is that input variable so you got initial input variable i just dragged that over there that became my input so now it only gon na find me project related to that portfolio and,An AI Agent that knows everything about your Projects & Portfolios
1,1_8,got initial input variable i just dragged that over there that became my input so now it only gon na find me project related to that portfolio and then i order them by plan start date then we need to do a flow action where we go through each record so we say for each item in our lookup record were gon na set a flow variable and this is where all the magic happens right so this is where weve got our flow variable that we create so you come over here and you go to flow variable and youre gon na wan na create a flow variable in my case i called it aggregated response and again it a string we set it to the output at the end but right now it just a flow variable and then were gon na set that flow variable so a it go through each project it gon na grab the name of the project manager it gon na grab the status state business case all of these relevant field and again you can put more field in the one thing you wan na do you wan na have your flow variable at the top so a it cycle through each,An AI Agent that knows everything about your Projects & Portfolios
1,1_9,field and again you can put more field in the one thing you wan na do you wan na have your flow variable at the top so a it cycle through each it continues to concatmate or sort of cycle after the next one so that you get all your data and then in the end what you have is this gigantic string of data and then you assign that to your output so our output is in our aggregated response so again were going through the project were pulling out relevant data field were writing those data field into a string and then were returning that string a the output so where are we gon na use the output you might ask well that is over in our skill kit skill so here is the portfolio answer skill kit this is where all the magic happens now i have a couple input you can see ive got the question a an input my field and then ive also got the portfolio record itself so ive got two different input input are when you know the value ahead of time tool are when you need to bring in the value when you need to,An AI Agent that knows everything about your Projects & Portfolios
1,1_10,itself so ive got two different input input are when you know the value ahead of time tool are when you need to bring in the value when you need to pull it in so you can see here ive got my get issue portfolio what we were just looking at get project for portfolio and i also have get status report for portfolio i could have combined these into one i broke them up because you know it seemed like a thing to do at the time but i could have combined them into one but you can see here it going for our get portfolio for get project for portfolio and my input value here is my sysid so that tie it all together when this run it gon na take that sysid from that original portfolio record and it gon na find the correct value in the information we want now over here is my prompt and i use the prompt assistance to write that prompt and then i just put in the different piece so youre basically answering question here the question then i have the name of the portfolio then i put in here the project,An AI Agent that knows everything about your Projects & Portfolios
1,1_11,in the different piece so youre basically answering question here the question then i have the name of the portfolio then i put in here the project record here are the associated status report and then here are the different potential issue and then i give it the instruction you know review the information and thats it then pretty much youre good to go once you activate it oh sorry there is one step you need to create the deployment ui action so when you come over here to the ui action youre gon na do something just a little bit different because we need our question a our input and then we need to write our value back to the answer so over here in our portfolio answer you can see over here is where i say the question is the current value of the new question field so im telling you what these different input value are by setting it off of the current portfolio record where we input that question onto the screen then down here were writing our response but you can see ive got it going,An AI Agent that knows everything about your Projects & Portfolios
1,1_12,the current portfolio record where we input that question onto the screen then down here were writing our response but you can see ive got it going into the answer field so it sends the query to the llm it get the information back writes it to the answer and then it update the ticket and thats it once youve finished publishing the skill you do need to go over to the now assist admin section and activate it from there so dont forget that very important step you go over here to our now assist admin i think it under experience oh no itll show up under feature other unless you put something else here you would just select it and then you just walk through the activation process it really easy you just click to thing it then set it active and this will change your ui action to active a well so you dont need to change the ui action this will go ahead and do it when you activate it so good luck hopefully itll be a straightforward for you a it wa for me if you have any question please feel,An AI Agent that knows everything about your Projects & Portfolios
1,1_13,go ahead and do it when you activate it so good luck hopefully itll be a straightforward for you a it wa for me if you have any question please feel free to post or reach out and good luck thanks everybody,An AI Agent that knows everything about your Projects & Portfolios
2,2_0,in today solo lauren episode of the breakpoint podcast we will be diving into the hottest topic on the market for both service now and tech in general a genetic ai specifically what the heck it even is how it being used on service now and frankly why you should care a lot a a developer in 2025 welcome to breakpoint the service now developer podcast hello service now admins builder developer and curious individual that i say with the utmost love and respect welcome to or welcome back to the breakpoint podcast the service now developer podcasts where we bring you all the latest tool tip and trade craft to accelerate your developer career my name is laura mcmahon and happy new year hopefully it not too late to say that quite quite yet im very excited to be here i hope everyone is having a awesome start to their 2025 and i figure you know we might a well do i guess what appears to be the quarterly solo lauren episode of the podcast my 2025 so far ha been off to a ridiculously roller,What Is Agentic AI and Why Should I Care?
2,2_1,we might a well do i guess what appears to be the quarterly solo lauren episode of the podcast my 2025 so far ha been off to a ridiculously roller coaster start not gon na lie we started off really high going on the awesome cruise all my closest girlfriend that wa amazing head a little bit of a peek when i got some really nasty flu followed by bronchitis but you know what were bringing back up because of high estate just one national championship so what more could i ask for a a columbus native work wise weve also had a tremendous amount of progress already if you want to hear a little bit of how the sausage is made weve already started kicking off all the internal production regime for knowledge 25 it hard to believe it that knowledge is approximately 70 ish work day away so it leaf u what seems to be a large amount of time but itd be quickly quickly absolved by all the work that ha to be done in fact one thing that i thought would be kind of fun to do this year wa kind of micro blog,What Is Agentic AI and Why Should I Care?
2,2_2,quickly absolved by all the work that ha to be done in fact one thing that i thought would be kind of fun to do this year wa kind of micro blog the experience of putting on something like creatorcon i figured you know maybe people would want to join in so if youre on linkedin i want to pas you along to the hashtag no25 behind the scene ill link it in the comment down below and thing like that and in the production note but hey ill be posting some micro blog update of what it like to put on knowledge and if you two are creating thing for knowledge whether thats lab or session i would love to see your experience a well in fact it could probably help enable a lot of others that maybe have not participated in the knowledge experience before but might be eyeing it for knowledge 26 on top of this our team is putting out our first of two tech now webinars next week where literally one week away i delayed this episode of breakpoint so it wa exactly one week away from tech now yoko hama if you,What Is Agentic AI and Why Should I Care?
2,2_3,webinars next week where literally one week away i delayed this episode of breakpoint so it wa exactly one week away from tech now yoko hama if you have not heard of tech now before that is the webinar completely dedicated to debuting the newest admin and developer feature of the new release we dont cover everything we dont cover itsm and hr and security that would take hour it a 60 minute webinar but every release we do this my entire team is involved kristi miriam earl duke prana of bugha and now travis tulson a well so a a team of five working on the production of tech now a we speak we have entered into the final week of rehearsal and we have a very exciting show for you so please register for tech now if you havent already again i will put the link down below a well a in the show note if you are listening to this on spotify apple podcasts etc now obviously those are just a couple of highlight from my year but before we dive into the topic i want to you know bring the mood down,What Is Agentic AI and Why Should I Care?
2,2_4,podcasts etc now obviously those are just a couple of highlight from my year but before we dive into the topic i want to you know bring the mood down slightly and just say that my heart is extended to all those currently undergoing the terrible wildfire in the la area obviously that ha been horrific to see a a third person perspective here in texas so i can not imagine going through it in real life my heart go out to all of you i know what a huge developer community that we have in california in general so please i will also be providing link to donate to help relief from the wildfire in the link down below and also in these show note if you are listening to this and auditory fashion now let bring the move back up a little bit let get thing rolling because we have a very exciting topic for today now in honor of my solo episode for the quarter i guess let dive straight in today topic and it a topic that is definitely ringing in the ear of anyone currently in tech in this service now,What Is Agentic AI and Why Should I Care?
2,2_5,quarter i guess let dive straight in today topic and it a topic that is definitely ringing in the ear of anyone currently in tech in this service now ecosystem especially anyone that is currently i dont know watching any form of medium in the last four to six week and that is a genetic ai if youve tuned into anything on tv hopefully like i said watching the ohio state buckais win the national championship youve seen edras elba talking about a genetic ai and our new slew of commercial that have come out for service now last week you might have also seen that service now a a company ha moved to acquire another company called qin and in the release information for that headline it also included the statement of the purpose for doing so wa to accelerate our agenetic ai roadmap if youve been on linkedin youve definitely been lambasted with post after post after post of mr handsome bill mcdermotts head over the advertisement for the agenetic ai live event that is happening also next week on,What Is Agentic AI and Why Should I Care?
2,2_6,after post after post of mr handsome bill mcdermotts head over the advertisement for the agenetic ai live event that is happening also next week on january 29 where specific tool are going to be debuted to the public a they are included in yoko hama and going forward and all that is to say that in the seven plus year ive worked at service now i have never never seen a push like this for a specific trend or product before so it begs to be asked what is a genetic ai so let talk about it and why you should care a a developer in the year 2025 i think one of the easiest way to start communicating what something is and maybe contrasting against what it is not for starter agenetic ai is different from the heavily popularized generative ai if youre going off of metaphor it would be very wise for you to compare the element of generative ai to polling a crowd right now granted that crowd is the size of probably the entire population of earth and could react in a way that no human being ever,What Is Agentic AI and Why Should I Care?
2,2_7,polling a crowd right now granted that crowd is the size of probably the entire population of earth and could react in a way that no human being ever could but it is pretty much the same you are asking a question to some sort of trained entity that represents an entire ecosystem of information and it is polling all that together to give you it best attempt at an answer if youre looking for thing in medium that compared to this pretty much any show where the protagonist is saying computer what is the that is a example of generative ai for one it reactive these computer or these algorithm or these ai are not necessarily going off on their own they are responding to a specific question or to a specific prompt they are also extremely dependent on having a large and a informed of a quote unquote crowd a possible the more data that generative ai is trained on the more comprehensive and accurate answer that it can provide if youre using one of the artistic rendering ai for example that had,What Is Agentic AI and Why Should I Care?
2,2_8,ai is trained on the more comprehensive and accurate answer that it can provide if youre using one of the artistic rendering ai for example that had only been trained on pablo picasso work asking it to create a picture of a rabbit might give you unexpected result you would want to train on the entire work of art at the louvre and the modern art ezm and historical artwork et cetera agenetic ai well obviously also ai is different than this if the medium comparison for generative ai to batman asking his computer to find data the agenetic ai comparison would be like the ai from the movie her with ockin phoenix or the ai in the episode revolving around cooky in black mirror unfortunately all the example of a genetic ai in medium are not the nicest so please dont let that cloud your judgment but thats oftentimes how it is used in scifi the first stark difference is a genetic ai is proactive not reactive it not only can anticipate what work or what thing need to be automated but can also,What Is Agentic AI and Why Should I Care?
2,2_9,first stark difference is a genetic ai is proactive not reactive it not only can anticipate what work or what thing need to be automated but can also improve the process a it act upon it over time and this is all without being asked to do so in addition to this a genetic ai is much less dependent on the size and variety of the information that it trained off of you could have an agenda ai thats trained off of all the world knowledge of workflow automation for example however let say that a a customer you would want an agentic ai system that act a lot specifically like service now in that case in point you would train it specifically off of service now workflow service now behavior service now architecture and therein lie the real distinction this is just the beginning of a genetic ai moving into the market i think moving forward you will see it branch off into much more specifically trained agent than something that is overall holistic in it response it is a very likely reality that,What Is Agentic AI and Why Should I Care?
2,2_10,see it branch off into much more specifically trained agent than something that is overall holistic in it response it is a very likely reality that in the future moving forward not only will you be doing your job but you might have to specifically trained a genetic ai clone of your work behavior helping you remove the minutia from your day now obviously that is much further down the line that we are at right now so what doe this actually mean for the service now platform a it exists in yokohama now im a little bit ahead of the game we will list out the specific functionality for our genetic ai release on january 29th again link below to please register for that event but i think the first thing i need to do is provide some clarity a the nomenclature of this release ha people a bit confused with the interface that it using in the screenshots a well a this name a ai agent a lot of people have been popularizing the notion that it something to do with virtual agent like it a beefier,What Is Agentic AI and Why Should I Care?
2,2_11,a well a this name a ai agent a lot of people have been popularizing the notion that it something to do with virtual agent like it a beefier version of virtual agent which could not be farther from the truth in virtual agent you are specifically designing conversation and exactly the different type of outcome that conversation could elicit you could have a myriad of answer but you are still specifically channeling people into predetermined bucket and if you recall a genetic ai doe not work in that fashion a part of it definition a genetic ai is a proactive independently acting entity so there no predetermined bucket that you would have to program into these ai agent at all instead the roadmap for our ai agent look something like this let say for example that you work for a company support desk team where you do thing like addressing ticket that are coming in from your customer base resetting password and escalating thing a they see fit these ai agent could do exactly that completely,What Is Agentic AI and Why Should I Care?
2,2_12,that are coming in from your customer base resetting password and escalating thing a they see fit these ai agent could do exactly that completely on their own it could not only do that around the clock and know when thing were routine enough to act on it own but it would also be smart enough to know when to escalate thing for human intervention because optimally that is the goal of ai i will say this ai ha had to do a lot to win me over a far a our team go i wa one of the bigger skeptic of ai a someone very passionate about art and the human element of art i think that is initially what triggered such a sour response to generative and subsequently a genetic ai but more and more with how i have seen it applied in customer use case the more it ha turned the tide of my opinion because ive seen what is really for the goal of ai with regard to automation in tech in corporate america it is not to remove the human element it is to maximize the time for it it is there to free u up from the,What Is Agentic AI and Why Should I Care?
2,2_13,to automation in tech in corporate america it is not to remove the human element it is to maximize the time for it it is there to free u up from the countless routine type of ticket that anybody could do rpa could do it a really heavy flow could do it but now we have ai agent that we dont even have to program to do it again this is talking very big picture and where service now is ideally heading towards a a company moving forward but if you would like to see what specifically ai agent can do in yokohama and i will tell you i wa blown away by this presentation please join the live it called the ai agent live launch it is january 29th and i hope to see you there now to all the ai nihilist kind of like myself out there that are saying ah this is another big tech trend this is the same a you know putting design wizard and everything and low code and everything it just going to be another bump in the roller coaster of corporate america let me really shatter that illusion for you like i,What Is Agentic AI and Why Should I Care?
2,2_14,code and everything it just going to be another bump in the roller coaster of corporate america let me really shatter that illusion for you like i said initially i have never in my seven year working here and almost 10 total working on the service now platform seen our company invest in a functionality like this agent ai is not just another buzz word is not just another trend for company to hop on and hop off a the year go by it is a paradigm shift for what work will be in the 21st century first consider the scaling perspective that this offer company sure ai agent cost money you will see that in any single platform that offer some form of agent ai moving forward it going to cost money however ai agent do cost less than another full time employee or even pop simply a part time employee now again thats not a to say that everyones going to get replaced with ai far from it instead imagine something like this every single team from it to hr having their own ai agent to handle all the,What Is Agentic AI and Why Should I Care?
2,2_15,to get replaced with ai far from it instead imagine something like this every single team from it to hr having their own ai agent to handle all the grunt work people put off doing anyway so that they can appropriately scale the human element and thats not even considering the added impact of decision making that this really offer people for anything that you do in your job think of the most routine thing something that you could do with your eye clothes in a heartbeat ai can do it faster not only that but ai can do it in the middle of the night when youre asleep or possibly when youre in the bathroom or on a work break or on pto ai doesnt have the human element of rest baked in so instead of coming back from a cruise like i did with a humongous pile of stuff that really didnt take too much brain power to get through but took a phenomenal amount of time to get caught up on what if you came back from pto and those type of thing were already taken care of again this might be one of the,What Is Agentic AI and Why Should I Care?
2,2_16,amount of time to get caught up on what if you came back from pto and those type of thing were already taken care of again this might be one of the more futuristic step of a gentick ai but think about how it can be fine tune to match aspect of real people that have left their impact on a specific process let say that you would set up a gentick ai to handle very specific routine email a team wa getting and however good a gentick ai is let say that the response were coming off a bit wouldnt but maybe there a person on your team that statistically ha a pretty good rate on return on these type of email maybe it their style or the speed in which they respond or the time of day in which they do their work but whatever that is let say that they statistically have the warmest response to those type of email the gentick ai could be trained specifically off that it remember it not generative ai we can make this a specific and niche a possible for the process that were utilizing a gentick ai for,What Is Agentic AI and Why Should I Care?
2,2_17,off that it remember it not generative ai we can make this a specific and niche a possible for the process that were utilizing a gentick ai for flow and automation were the first step in abstracting away the minutia from people everyday job allowing them to do that impactful work the only human can do an agentic ai is just the natural next step to that process and before closing up today discussion about a gentick ai i want to get a huge shout out to earl duke hay on our team where i have been probably the big the big spooky nihilist about ai he ha been the ai champion and a lot of the information today that what ive presented on is directly taken from something that he did internally for our team so i wanted to give a shout out to him and thank him for also helping open my eye to the prospect that agentic ai is really going to offer not only people on service now but on other platform and in the corporate ecosystem moving forward again im going to keep hammering at home because im,What Is Agentic AI and Why Should I Care?
2,2_18,only people on service now but on other platform and in the corporate ecosystem moving forward again im going to keep hammering at home because im part of the marketing department we have the ai agent launch on january 29th 2025 at 12 pm central standard time so i hope to see you in the comment because i will definitely be there a well i cant wait to see your actual live opinion on everything baked into yokohama additionally the day immediately after is tech now so if youre like i want to see everything relevant for admins builder and developer join u for that webinar and i will again ill include the link to register for that webinar below a at 10 am central standard time on january 30th also if youve made it this far into the podcast i have a little sweet treat for you a well just a reminder that historically at least there no confirmation i cant make any promise but historically the most recent release available happens to go on to pdis on ea a well which is the day we are doing,What Is Agentic AI and Why Should I Care?
2,2_19,i cant make any promise but historically the most recent release available happens to go on to pdis on ea a well which is the day we are doing tech now so not only should you keep your eye and ear open for information coming out of tech now but also be sure to keep refreshing that developer service now website to ensure that you are one of the first people that get to experience yokohama completely for free now were keeping thing short and sweet to start off the new year so i want to say thank you wonderful listener for joining me here today dont forget to check out the other amazing service now podcast you can find them on the community site under the event tab dont ask me why also subscribe you can subscribe here on youtube if you are watching the video version or a well on any podcasting provider whether that be spotify apple podcasts et cetera one thing i would like to start encouraging you to do is also leave u a review if you have not ever reviewed breakpoint before we are,What Is Agentic AI and Why Should I Care?
2,2_20,et cetera one thing i would like to start encouraging you to do is also leave u a review if you have not ever reviewed breakpoint before we are trying to expand the audience that is consuming it so leaving a positive review help u do just that breakpoint is brought to you by servicenow with me laura mcmahon and a the producer to find out more about the service now developer program and to get one of those yokohama pdis go to developerservicenowcom again thank you so much for joining me here today a wonderful listener stay hungry stay humble and have a fantastic start to 2025 cheer please let u know what you think about this podcast you can leave feedback or ask question in the servicenow community for more great information on servicenow development check out the servicenow developer portal at developerservicenowcom thanks for listening what is a gentiged ai cant wait to see how that come out on the video what even is a gentiged ai little asmr for you guy,What Is Agentic AI and Why Should I Care?
3,3_0,hello everyone welcome to another episode of our podcast today were going to dive again into an egente ai framework and i have another technology leader with me ronnie zeus join u from israel ronnie welcome how are you good good thank you how are you doing yes great and were going to dive into awesome stuff today he a leader building product for ai ops for a long time bringing a lot of new innovation im really excited to have him on this podcast before we dive in ronnie tell me a little bit about the you use gini tvi in your world of course you do youre making new product but anything interesting that you do with it every day they are all in our both exploring different technology in gini and personally using it really helped me to arrange my thought and put together my thought into structure way to make sure that the message im trying to convey are clear and concise so it super helpful for me yeah thats ready i started to use a little bit with my kid to make different image try to,Agentic AI workflows for AIOps
3,3_1,to convey are clear and concise so it super helpful for me yeah thats ready i started to use a little bit with my kid to make different image try to understand their imagination what they can imagine and how gini tvi tool can help them create something that they are thinking about so let dive right in and i want to you know be a deep knowledge of machine learning in ai in a traditional way and now shifting towards agentic framework how doe in your world agentic ai framework differ from a traditional ai machine learning framework yeah so the thing is that when you look on traditional ai and ml framework mainly focus on data processing and pattern recognition and they provide insight and prediction and recommendation but really require a human intervention for the execution but when you look on a gini on the other hand it introduces a lot of autonomous and decision making entity that actually understand the environment which is super critical in our space to understand exactly different,Agentic AI workflows for AIOps
3,3_2,autonomous and decision making entity that actually understand the environment which is super critical in our space to understand exactly different type of data it also have reasoning and planning capability to provide solution which is based on neither historical data or real time context and it able to act on behalf of people so it could be your own copilot or your own little minion that help you do do and it also ha the ability to learn and adapt like any other ml and ai form from user feedback and continuously refining their decision so this end to end actually make the agentic ai far more dynamic and and action oriented than just traditional ai model which are focused on insight and prediction yeah youre the second person who said the word copilot this week in the podcast i had another customer actually said that i think is a concept of a you said using it to create action is really whats becoming very useful for in a daily life but also for our customer so let dive in a little,Agentic AI workflows for AIOps
3,3_3,of a you said using it to create action is really whats becoming very useful for in a daily life but also for our customer so let dive in a little bit into the world we live in that is it operation how are you seeing agentic ai enhance the it operation and maybe some example of what youre working on and coming up in the near future yeah so if you look on a jtnkia this is actually going to transform how it operation are working today so it going to be more focusing on automatic decision making and execution it will significantly reduce the manual burden on it team so unlike traditional ai which is primarily analyzed data and provide insight the agent can autonomously act on alert and prioritize task and even resolve issue all while keeping operation in control so for the it operation this mean faster resolution because ai agent will triage correlate and assign task in real time it will be you can imagine proactive issue prevention because the ai will be in the position to detect issue,Agentic AI workflows for AIOps
3,3_4,correlate and assign task in real time it will be you can imagine proactive issue prevention because the ai will be in the position to detect issue that indicates potential failure potential outage and recommend on execute preventive action and it also reduced the operation load because ai agent will be able to handle a lot of repetitive troubleshooting task and letting the operator focus on highvalue problem rather than just another task that i have to perform so it going to unleash the power of to empower operator to be much more focused on highvalue or critical issue yeah so i guess when we speak in the term of autonomous and again i guess we think about various way one is autonomous assisted human in the loop human on the loop all these are different way customer and enterprise start to adopt it do you think about a maturity based on where our customer are and how would you baseline that maturity if they want to move to an agentic framework yeah so when we think about how our user,Agentic AI workflows for AIOps
3,3_5,where our customer are and how would you baseline that maturity if they want to move to an agentic framework yeah so when we think about how our user our customer will adopt this kind of a technology what we imagine is how the agentic ai actually take responsibility on piece of the entire user journey of our user so if our user are let say operator or any technology owner they have their user journey they are facing alert and they have to try to ask the alert they have to investigate them they have to find the root cause analysis of them they have to remediate the issue they have to escalate the issue they have to create all sort of task or record to other people all of these task are part of the user journey they are doing on their day to day and we can imagine ai agent take full control over piece of that journey but taking full control nothing the matter of replacing the user but actually empowering the user because the ai agent will be able to collect the data analyze the data and,Agentic AI workflows for AIOps
3,3_6,nothing the matter of replacing the user but actually empowering the user because the ai agent will be able to collect the data analyze the data and bring the bottom line and the decision to the user to take the decision so the user can decide or let the ai agent do everything automatically or decide to be the one that is taking the decision for each and every step so it kind of saving the time of our user from doing the repetitive task and doing the deep level investigation and just provide the bottom line to the user and ask them for their approval or the decision so the agent can continuously do the task for them in an automatic way i want to like what our ceo bill mcdermott say is we are building agent in the agent in service of human so i think that say a lot about the maturity of our customer a they adopted one question that come up a we are experimenting with different large language model is there are so many out there now and there are benchmark so theyre right sometimes the,Agentic AI workflows for AIOps
3,3_7,a we are experimenting with different large language model is there are so many out there now and there are benchmark so theyre right sometimes the entropic lot come out really well on when coding task are asked our deep seek actually brought a very good reasoning technique and we have the gpt model and the mini model doing really good reasoning so in your world a youre developing new product how do you see these different model come together to solve specific problem or use case yeah very interesting so what we can see is ai agent that can collaborate across multiple llm so you have multiple agent that are able to collaborate and converse between them each ai agent is a master of a specific task or a decision each one of them can actually use specialized llm to handle different task so the ai agent they can call api they can interact with observability tool they can communicate with other agent at the end of the day each one of them is specialized in at certain task so and each one,Agentic AI workflows for AIOps
3,3_8,observability tool they can communicate with other agent at the end of the day each one of them is specialized in at certain task so and each one of them can can work across different llm so the kind of approach that we are taking is that ai agent are integrating across different product across different domain that are used different llm according to their specialized model and this goal is actually maximizing the ai efficiency while ensuring seamless collaboration between agent and user cool let let try down an example maybe in operation world a you said before triaging is really important outage deduction time to detect an outage and then remediate that outage is really important for all the idea operation leader so if you think about that scenario that we live in day and day out how would you need to take framework help that yeah so let talk about first about our user let imagine an operator that is bombed with dozen or hundred of alert a day covering different technology,Agentic AI workflows for AIOps
3,3_9,yeah so let talk about first about our user let imagine an operator that is bombed with dozen or hundred of alert a day covering different technology different service and application they have a real real trouble to understand exactly what is in priority what is the impact of the issue doe it even matter to anyone and then after realizing the priority of it they have to understand the impact of it and what exactly is the issue and how to remediate that and now imagine that these operator are not always have access to all the different observability tool and they theyre not necessarily the one expert in a certain technology so the ai agent by using different ai agent and integrating and integrating also with potentially external ai vendor or external observability tool with very were able to using this ai agent to process all these information and provide the operator the bottom line of it which mean what is the issue what is the impact of the issue who is impacted by the issue and,Agentic AI workflows for AIOps
3,3_10,and provide the operator the bottom line of it which mean what is the issue what is the impact of the issue who is impacted by the issue and what is usually being done in such case now you have different ai that are collaborating with each other each is providing their own insight into it and then we can actually bring the bottom line plus the action to the user for example an action could be do you want me to create an incident for you the user or do you want me just to close this alert because it not that impactful or do you want me to run an automation which is premade in our system for you so the thing is that instead of the user going search and find and ask for people to access to certain tool the ai agent will do that for them and will bring the insight plus the action to perform instead of them so it imagine that the operator instead of just looking on a bunch of alert they will look only on the high impacting one the one that requires manual intervention the one that requires,Agentic AI workflows for AIOps
3,3_11,of just looking on a bunch of alert they will look only on the high impacting one the one that requires manual intervention the one that requires some level of escalation and all the repetitive task will be done for them yeah one thing that you mentioned is so crucial a the enterprise use a regional platform is ability for them to harness the real time and the historical data that is present already in the platform a you mentioned incident change problem and knowledge that is already available to them the ability for u to provide that realtime monitoring and you know and and cobble that together all of it in a very seamless fashion and a we building new data fabric and ability to bring rapid dp so we have multiple set of data right i mean in a lot of time we are looking at monitoring discovery data but then there are other set of data maybe present in data lake that may be able to help with this reaging right i mean do you think that could also happen in the future definitely you know,Agentic AI workflows for AIOps
3,3_12,present in data lake that may be able to help with this reaging right i mean do you think that could also happen in the future definitely you know youll have specialized agent in for example finding the right knowledge base article instead of the user going in search for knowledge base article reading ton of them just to understand which one is the one relevant youll have an agent do that for them and just will provide them the bottom line and summarize kind of a summary of the relevant kbr article with the exact step it could be also an external body of knowledge it could be an external website which is coming with the industry knowledge it could be something which we are passing from the resolution note of past incident or some relevant change that happened recently or for something from observability tool all of that youll have different agent providing all these insight of course not each one of them is relevant for each and every issue everything will be orchestrated so only the,Agentic AI workflows for AIOps
3,3_13,agent providing all these insight of course not each one of them is relevant for each and every issue everything will be orchestrated so only the most meaningful and the bottom line will be surface to the user with the actual outcome instead of you know instead of taking data from all of the place is just bomb the user with all with ton of data we will just process everything and provide him the bottom line of it sure blocked on pack here and youre working diligently on this new development so you know well bring you back here a lot more of these agent released anything you want to tell our customer and who are looking to get into this space in term of how they can get involved or any other thing that we you know any outcome that we didnt talk about that you want to say yeah so a lot of time im being asked like okay what why should i do that what would be the outcome why should i invest in adopting ai into my organization because it a big change right we need to train our user to now,Agentic AI workflows for AIOps
3,3_14,that what would be the outcome why should i invest in adopting ai into my organization because it a big change right we need to train our user to now interact with ai to understand exactly the recommendation that are coming with ai to interact with ai to give to provide feedback for ai there a lot of oh a lot of adoption exercise that ha to occur with our customer and what we are telling our customer is that we need to be focused on the outcome what are we going to what are you going to gain by using it and it all it down to the standard kpis like increasing the productivity of your user the manual burden of different you know different task being much more proactive and predictive operation and obviously to lower the mttr and maybe eliminate at different outage with this capability imagine that instead of having a group of 10 operator youre actually going to multiply that by the number of agent that are going to work and youre not going to hire more and more people to perform more,Agentic AI workflows for AIOps
3,3_15,youre actually going to multiply that by the number of agent that are going to work and youre not going to hire more and more people to perform more and more task youre just going to delegate a lot to the ai and then your human user will be the one that are going to supervise the ai imagine that the new operator will be the one to supervise on ai agent so instead of being hammered by you know different alert there will be the one to make sure that the ai is doing the work for them and it will be focusing on the meaningful work so youre going to multiply your operation just by delegating more and more capability to ai awesome and we will leave your contact information a well in this podcast so people can reach out and i think a plug for everyone is if you want to get involved you can be an early adopter program the thing that we have done since last year in the it operation management product help you accelerate the adoption rate so you dont have to wait for a certain you know cmdb,Agentic AI workflows for AIOps
3,3_16,since last year in the it operation management product help you accelerate the adoption rate so you dont have to wait for a certain you know cmdb population or generally if you try to look at the data hygiene you dont have to wait right so for all those thing you can adopt these capability quickly experiment and test them right away in matter of peak without waiting for a longer adoption cycle and then if you have a high rate data you want to bring it in a i said we have not only the monitoring capability to inject that information but also the data fabric to bring in various data store with that ronnie thanks for being here i know it very late for you so thanks for being a great sport always a pleasure and let get you back here soon but thanks for coming on board and thanks for your listening,Agentic AI workflows for AIOps
4,4_0,hello everyone welcome to another episode of the podcast today were going to dive back into agente ai again and today i have another technology leader with me victor chen join me victor how are you doing well thank you why dont you give a quick intro of yourself sure so my name is victor chen i am an outbound product manager at servicenow i cover everything now assist with particularly focusing on our agente ai a well a our virtual agent awesome just the right guy we need for this podcast let i ask this to every host how do you use ai in your personal life or day to day thing that you do any example you have yeah i mean ive used i use chat gpt since the very beginning and i recently used microsoft copa i wa trying to build a power out of made flow on sharepoint i couldnt quite figure it out so i just asked copa hey im trying to do this how do you do it and you know it pretty helpful in giving me the step and i asked chat gpt to so between those two tool i wa able to get this flow,ServiceNow's agentic AI framework explained: What you need to know
4,4_1,how do you do it and you know it pretty helpful in giving me the step and i asked chat gpt to so between those two tool i wa able to get this flow working for a tool i almost never use im not familiar with this so it wa very helpful for that situation thats nice yeah i typically use even when i creating this podcast i use a couple of different tool and help me out along with the tool i use here at riverside but also the chat gpt or even copa so kind of coming a couple of different thing which is very helpful all right awesome let dive right in it a whole lot of talk about agente ai and it framework but what doe it look like in the context of service now platform yeah so service now we built our own agente ai framework on the now platform it is native to the now platform we didnt acquire company not a bolt on and you know it additive to the innovation and the investment made to the platform over time both by customer who built on the platform a well a u whove innovated onto it and,ServiceNow's agentic AI framework explained: What you need to know
4,4_2,to the innovation and the investment made to the platform over time both by customer who built on the platform a well a u whove innovated onto it and firstly that mean the ability to use now the now platform data richness so im talking about your user data your cmedb your knowledge and all the external enterprise data that have people that folk and customer have tied into the now platform of the integration hub and soon also the tool available and workflow data fabric so like zero copy data et cetera so that all that data is what give agente the context and the know how to fulfill it objective and then there the workflow that are on the now platform so all our customer they have workflow of service now whether it for it hr crm and these workflow now also become tool for the agent to call upon and execute where need be so you got data you have workflow you tie that all in in the now platform thats secure and scalable and you have a very powerful starting point error foundation to build,ServiceNow's agentic AI framework explained: What you need to know
4,4_3,have workflow you tie that all in in the now platform thats secure and scalable and you have a very powerful starting point error foundation to build and deploy agent for your work nice now you talked about a couple of thing i want to dive deeper one of them is data of course so what is the maturity of a customer look like a they start adopting ai agent is there a data maturity also in there and aspect of that yeah so like you know certainly thats a very pertinent question that a lot of our customer ask u like are we ready for you know ai or agente ai and certainly you know customer to your very first question to me like how do you use gen ai in your life like customer need to be familiar with gen ai tool and workflow of both that service now and you know in the in the broader technology environment and be comfortable with large language model large language model what they can do a perhaps some of their limitation a well right and thats been true since early gpt up to chat gpt up to,ServiceNow's agentic AI framework explained: What you need to know
4,4_4,model large language model what they can do a perhaps some of their limitation a well right and thats been true since early gpt up to chat gpt up to today right llm are constantly evolving but there are always thing you need to be aware of etc so customer should be able to should look at how they deploy test and manage gen ai tool in the enterprise always this 10 go for any ai tool and so thats the kind of governance structure with a thought space an ai mature company should have u in you know service now ha that and like on the technical side data drive performance of these agent and the llm have powered them right so customer should have a strong data governance system process when it come to their knowledge base catalog service catalog and task etc there also a dimension workflow data fabric so that allows our customer to get data from business application data lake and a variety of right of data source right and that kind of data might not be present in service now already but,ServiceNow's agentic AI framework explained: What you need to know
4,4_5,from business application data lake and a variety of right of data source right and that kind of data might not be present in service now already but based on agile method we have our customer are able to grab that data and apply it to these agent take or ai use case and i think that is seamless for our customer right and then the government we think about data governance a lot of our customer have this question like yeah if the data is present in service now platform we know that but when you are grabbing data from external source how doe all landscape of governance and management look like yeah exactly so youre exactly right a service now doesnt need to be the keeper of all your data if you want to integrate your data with the now platform we allow that if you want again zero copy and just connecting to your data lake or your enterprise application without any of that data leaving that application of the ecosystem also fine but we are extensible and flexible to that point when it,ServiceNow's agentic AI framework explained: What you need to know
4,4_6,application without any of that data leaving that application of the ecosystem also fine but we are extensible and flexible to that point when it come to data governance we talked a little bit about that earlier but at a moral like tactical level it make a sure for example that your data is clean that your knowledge base is up to date so again data cleanliness is always important regardless of the topic right and it important like if customer are using agent to resolve incident for example then there should be a good track record or a good historical record event that have been resolved in the past with documentation like work note and you know you probably have comment or attachment in there and thats how agent ai agent can learn and generate resolution plan accordingly right so ai agent can generate a plan to resolve it and then act upon that plan there a flip side you want to make sure that agent also dont access any data that you dont want them to have you know excluding or kind,ServiceNow's agentic AI framework explained: What you need to know
4,4_7,that plan there a flip side you want to make sure that agent also dont access any data that you dont want them to have you know excluding or kind of managing out outdated knowledge article just one example right pii is another consideration the good news you know the service now platform we have sensitive data handling tool that allows you to mask sensitive data allows you to manage that in a lowcode format so youre not starting from scratch you know when it come to data governance you know we provide these tool and the platform itself provides that foundation to accelerate your deployment for ai tool confidently we work with data construction and other kind of the partner right to make sure like hugging face and others to make sure that we are following the guard rail and guideline described by other consortium a well yeah yeah we have guard rail for our llems we have guard rail for data usage privacy security you know all the security and privacy policy that youre already familiar,ServiceNow's agentic AI framework explained: What you need to know
4,4_8,guard rail for our llems we have guard rail for data usage privacy security you know all the security and privacy policy that youre already familiar with on the now platform you know the equally applied to our ai tool nice let dive into the topic that i find very interesting and thats for everyone out there large language model there been of course activity every single day about whether it open ai or deep seek or cloud we just saw a couple of model come out version over the weekend past couple of day a well so how do we integrate these various model into building new use case and how doe it use it it look like but what is the landscape of managing these model for our customer look like in the future a well what do you see that right now yeah yeah no youre absolutely right like you know the past month ha seen a proliferation of large language model by every company trying to be the best model at the lowest cost and that is good for service now and that is good for our customer right,ServiceNow's agentic AI framework explained: What you need to know
4,4_9,model by every company trying to be the best model at the lowest cost and that is good for service now and that is good for our customer right and you know so in our gentrific framework we use large you know just folk in an effort moment we use large language model to orchestrate your team of agent generating those plan of action and then executing that action or series of action along with human and user feedback of what we like to call human on the loop the other way that large language model are used is also used by the agent tool so that could be for example if you want your agent to generate a knowledge article search for information or run a custom now assist skill that youve built on the now platform those also use large language model and the good news for our customer and for our customer is that we service now we are also constantly evaluating model to use in term of performance and price and when customer use now assist they have the they have two option mainly they can use,ServiceNow's agentic AI framework explained: What you need to know
4,4_10,evaluating model to use in term of performance and price and when customer use now assist they have the they have two option mainly they can use the llm that we host and that mean you know we host the llm there no customer data leaving the service now ecosystem or being used to train whatever model right and customer dont have to worry about double paying for token right we manage all that the other way to use the model is just bring is bringing on model right so for those of you for those customer who are familiar with our generative ai controller weve had that principle for a long time it like hey you can use your own model to run genai workflow on the now platform you can use your own model to run custom skill on now assist skill kit and then looking forward yes you can use bring your own model whether it open ai and thropic gemini what have you right to run ai agent virtual agent or other now assist skill so we are definitely you know in the spirit of extensibility and flexibility,ServiceNow's agentic AI framework explained: What you need to know
4,4_11,have you right to run ai agent virtual agent or other now assist skill so we are definitely you know in the spirit of extensibility and flexibility were going to open that up you know very very soon nice and the good thing about the industry is the training cost and the inference cost been just going down so significantly that customer dont really have to kind of worry about a lot of this and with service now giving them sort of a platform where they can apply different use case together where theyre distilled model or you know a you said bring your own model it just make a very happy medium for our customer going forward yeah and then you know again the model to your point is just a tool that layer on top of the platform that you have right it could be whatever llm and it a platform that again provides the data the workflow the governance tool the security all that so that we abstract that complexity away a much a possible so our customer can get time to value a quickly a possible,ServiceNow's agentic AI framework explained: What you need to know
4,4_12,tool the security all that so that we abstract that complexity away a much a possible so our customer can get time to value a quickly a possible with these ai tool with ai agent it an interesting actually it called javan sparadox if you have heard about it it an interesting way of a the technology go much cheaper the kind of the adoption of that technology or use case actually accelerate so for our customer and u a well a the cost of model come down it just mean youre going to have more adoption and easily you know you can do more thing with it so thats thats amazing and that actually lead me to this one other question is a these model proliferate and technology becomes available in our platform which i call our platform is very extensive to so many use case what are some of the most significant outcome that our customer can expect yeah i know thats a great question you know what i tell folk is the big unlock for ai agent is productivity at scale ai agent never rest they operate 247,ServiceNow's agentic AI framework explained: What you need to know
4,4_13,i know thats a great question you know what i tell folk is the big unlock for ai agent is productivity at scale ai agent never rest they operate 247 theyre constantly observing receiving issue and taking action on behalf of whether you know it their end user employee whether it perhaps a service desk or you know team of fulfilleders and this enables customer to raise expectation on fulfilling the kpis and the objective that your business ha whether thats thats issue deflection or whether thats time you know mean time to resolution esat csat et cetera right like every business ha these for example for hr employee satisfaction hr onboarding for example and for crm right making sure your customer get the resolution they need make sure your customer are satisfied and happy and come back to you for more right ai agent will touch every corner of the business and their ability to automate and their ability to achieve efficiency so it a very exciting space really you know dare say your,ServiceNow's agentic AI framework explained: What you need to know
4,4_14,of the business and their ability to automate and their ability to achieve efficiency so it a very exciting space really you know dare say your imagination is really the limit and what ai agent can achieve and what they can unlock for those who are using them yeah thats well said just like our ceo say well right a you said imagination is your limit and then also i like what he say about that our ai agent in service to human right so thats your point a well earlier a we wrap up i know it a lot happening in this space and were going to have a lot of exciting development in the coming week how can our customer keep on top of these development and stay in touch with whatever is next just coming on the agentic framework yeah so this is where i plug all our service now content right so were going to be making a lot of exciting announcement for when we release ai agent to general availability with our yoke ahama release on march 12 so definitely stay tuned for that yeah stay tuned on our,ServiceNow's agentic AI framework explained: What you need to know
4,4_15,for when we release ai agent to general availability with our yoke ahama release on march 12 so definitely stay tuned for that yeah stay tuned on our website and if you go to servicenowcom you see we have a lot of information and a lot of thing to share content to share their ai agent there always going to be the opportunity to get more indepth knowledge and to join discussion with your peer on community if youre a customer on partner portal if youre a partner right and you know wherever you get your service now kind of twitter linkedin or i guess i should call it x x linkedin etc right and of course id be remiss if our customer if i dont mention our customer should come to knowledge right our knowledge conference in may and there were going to show off the future of the genetic ai at service now you get the opportunity to hear from our product team ill be there and youll be able to get a handson look on how ai agent will transform business and expectation for what ai can do for you,ServiceNow's agentic AI framework explained: What you need to know
4,4_16,product team ill be there and youll be able to get a handson look on how ai agent will transform business and expectation for what ai can do for you and what ai can do on the now platform so those are the place i would definitely take a look at so you know please if you have the opportunity register for knowledge visit a website awesome thats a great plug victor it wa a pleasure to have you on the podcast well get you back here a we get more development going thanks for listening everyone im bye for now thank you,ServiceNow's agentic AI framework explained: What you need to know
5,5_0,welcome everyone to another edition of the servicenow enterprise agility podcast im your host fred champlain servicenow agile of angelus and im delighted to introduce our first external guest underpodcast richard naster richard is a safe fellow a former methodologist and contributor to the safe framework while at scale agile and he the author of six book including most recently the lean agile way a leased business result in the digital era with value stream management welcome richard it a pleasure to have you here thank you fred it great to be here richard there a number of topic that weve talked about weve had some good chat while weve been preparing and id love to just ask you about business agility a our primary topic and get a sense of whats happening where are you seeing in industry and a company are confronting disruptors from numerous technology we see ai popping up and of course all kind of industry what kind of example are you seeing out there of this disruption and how are,AI and Business Agility: Enhancing Human Intelligence
5,5_1,technology we see ai popping up and of course all kind of industry what kind of example are you seeing out there of this disruption and how are company taking on that disruption how are they responding yeah so i think it very interesting time today ai is having an enormous impact on all of our life and i kind of say that i dont recall any technology that ha quickly transformed the business landscape a quickly a ai and how quickly the technology ha been able to be integrated into existing solution and we really have no idea yet were just at the infancy and yet there a lot of thing that are being developed which is allowing business to operate in way they never thought before and i think there tremendous opportunity for cost saving i also think it can have a huge impact on organization to better be able to have greater business agility being able to sense and respond to whats happening in the marketplace getting insight from our customer service data and more it really incredible im,AI and Business Agility: Enhancing Human Intelligence
5,5_2,being able to sense and respond to whats happening in the marketplace getting insight from our customer service data and more it really incredible im very excited about it at the same time a little bit scared and im glad im not 20 year old now because i would think maybe i wouldnt have a job that a chatbot or some kind of ai will take my job for sure there a lot of concern around what wa that future state look like and right now a you said in the infancy of this it exciting time but there trepidation i think a well but what you mentioned is really key though is the sense and respond were really taking that to a whole nother level in term of response time taking signal telemetry from our system understanding where customer sentiment is a well a being able to make faster decision and higher quality decision a well so a you think about what those interaction are like and from product and product introduction and update and refreshes and new feature thing are really speeding up where do,AI and Business Agility: Enhancing Human Intelligence
5,5_3,those interaction are like and from product and product introduction and update and refreshes and new feature thing are really speeding up where do you see the customer centristy aspect of ai where do you see that coming to play yeah so one of the thing that come to mind is there often a lot of weak signal out there that we just cant perceive so for example when someone call into your call center information is recorded in the database in the customer service database or they exchange problem with a chatbot this data is coming in from many different way and there hundred of thousand of interaction and there gold in those interaction but we often can connect the dot between what people are saying and the signal that theyre providing it just too weak we just cant make sense of all that data we have an explosion of data today but not able to make sense so one of the thing that im excited about is using ai to interrogate the different database where we have these interaction with our,AI and Business Agility: Enhancing Human Intelligence
5,5_4,to make sense so one of the thing that im excited about is using ai to interrogate the different database where we have these interaction with our customer and be able to know what complaint that they have what are some of the idea they have to improve our product and service what are the thing that theyre actually using we want to make sure what we deliver to the market is actually being used and all of these thing typically we dont get those strong signal and when were doing software development product development today we need to understand whats happening and the world isnt completely homogeneous so we cant say that one customer is the same a the other so being able to detect these signal and then be able to sense whats happening and then coming up with the way to respond and we can actually ask our ai well how should we respond to these particular problem which is kind of cool which is one replacement human thinking but it may give u some idea and some insight on how we can,AI and Business Agility: Enhancing Human Intelligence
5,5_5,to these particular problem which is kind of cool which is one replacement human thinking but it may give u some idea and some insight on how we can address those problem or issue or enhancement and also to make sure that they get ratted to the right people so thats another aspect of ai i like to think of it a intelligent automation some people called agentec ai or agent ai is that it can do a task based upon the information that wa presented to the ai so if youre doing generative ai or using chat that it can then take the next step so let say you call into your cable company or not call into cable company let say you used a chatbot in your cable company and youre saying i cant get a good picture on the screen and usually you go through a phone call youve got to get to an agent they ask you to authenticate you and blah blah blah before you know what half an hour ha gone by and nothing ha actually been helping you right it very good yeah yeah weve all had that common experience yeah it,AI and Business Agility: Enhancing Human Intelligence
5,5_6,know what half an hour ha gone by and nothing ha actually been helping you right it very good yeah yeah weve all had that common experience yeah it frustrating right and you get the same experience kind of with some of these chat application a well especially when it not alive especially when it a live person rather and then go through a script and they cant deviate from a script imagine now you have an intelligent bot and when you speak to it it then say okay well have you rebooted your router a an example and you say no and it come back and say would you like me to reboot your router okay sound like a good idea yes then it go ahead and reboots your router it know when the router ha been rebooted and say okay can you please try again and let me know if the issue ha been resolved and so right then and there you can say yes or no if you say yes it might then go ahead and do another action this is where the agent aspect of ai come in this intelligent automation and then it go ahead and,AI and Business Agility: Enhancing Human Intelligence
5,5_7,yes it might then go ahead and do another action this is where the agent aspect of ai come in this intelligent automation and then it go ahead and close the ticket if you say no well then it will know what do we do next to troubleshoot your problem it may ask you more clarifying question and based upon all this wealth of information that we have about how to troubleshoot problem we are going to get better response also perhaps this is not the first time you called in most chatbots if theyre not intelligent will not know that you just called u called last week but this time it say well you called yesterday about this is this the same problem exactly knowing the context right the history right knowing the context is really great so i think there is a way that we can really improve customer service using ai and then having people so when you really need to speak to a person they can actually spend quality time with you and theyre not focusing on the routine problem that are time,AI and Business Agility: Enhancing Human Intelligence
5,5_8,when you really need to speak to a person they can actually spend quality time with you and theyre not focusing on the routine problem that are time consuming to respond to but are easily automated and for customer to feel better about their interaction especially a were able to more humanize ai and perhaps you see an avatar of a person acting a an agent perhaps youre even speaking to it in the future it not very far off right now the main interface ha been texted with the chatbot but i imagine that it will be much more voice interaction with bot and feeling like youre speaking to a person rather than to an impersonal bot sure when weve seen it with alexa and siri right weve gone that direction so just now a matter of closing that gap and i agree it probably going to become the more common interface rather than typing thing out and so it really what you mentioned wa it really having that credibility too being able to trust and it not just some script that youre being read back to from,AI and Business Agility: Enhancing Human Intelligence
5,5_9,really what you mentioned wa it really having that credibility too being able to trust and it not just some script that youre being read back to from an agent maybe a live agent and you said that we can actually also harvest from that in term of the data the sentiment of course we can analyze this in real time a well and so we can really trust what were being told it engaging but were also collecting and a you said figuring out behind the scene whats the next best action what do we do next a this dialogue continues so and then were letting human really work and add value where human do the best work right right so removing some of that repetitive inquiry and really getting to the hard stuff where we need to put people so yeah it pretty fascinating how fast this is accelerated yeah and im optimistic about that you know every time weve had a new technology there always been fear that it going to take people job and while that may be true i think it will add job a much a it will,AI and Business Agility: Enhancing Human Intelligence
5,5_10,weve had a new technology there always been fear that it going to take people job and while that may be true i think it will add job a much a it will eliminate job so i think there will be a balance i think well better able to use the creative mind of people so if im calling in for customer service an example we can take them off the script and make and type thing into chat into general ai to ask question of their own source of internal information to get answer plus be able to query lot of source of information about maybe this ha happened before what did we do to resolve this in the past is this a totally novel problem you know is a system down can we we can check that quickly oh yeah there an adogenior area i mean there so many different thing that ai can augment human intelligence i dont see ai replacing human intelligence but it going to augment human intelligence,AI and Business Agility: Enhancing Human Intelligence
6,6_0,hello everyone welcome to a kbdi podcast we are reviewing a new set of topic and you will see a lot of focus on agentic ai starting this year so a you probably know service now is very deep into the three pillar that come to work for the fabric that combine all data from different discourse all your infrastructure and other data source then we combine it into creating action with ai agent and then creating assisted and autonomous workflow so a service now unravels this whole space we will be bringing you with new topic around this today i have an expert in observability and denika shae join u from san francisco hi denika who are you hi im good who are you yeah good good so this is going to be one of the first topic in this space or first episode were going to talk about were going to zoom into the observability world and what doe the ai agent mean for that so with that before we actually dive in denika why dont you quickly introduce yourself hi yeah hey everyone i am danica i am a,Creating an agentic AI framework for observability
6,6_1,ai agent mean for that so with that before we actually dive in denika why dont you quickly introduce yourself hi yeah hey everyone i am danica i am a product director in the ai ops team and i lead a bunch of initiative within ai ops one of them is building ai agent thats awesome yes i thats a great plug actually this observability is a part of a broader ai ops solution a well so both ai ops and observability go ahead and end so were going to get into both of those thing a little bit more today and a lot more in the future so a we dive in denika why dont you start with actually telling your perspective or what you think when you think of a gent dig when you think of ai agent what come to you what your mind when you think about this space i think for me it mostly like from a pragmatic sense it the access to information so ai agent make access to information access to complicated information much easier for any persona right i think with the rise of ai and llm what the most powerful,Creating an agentic AI framework for observability
6,6_2,access to information access to complicated information much easier for any persona right i think with the rise of ai and llm what the most powerful thing about them is that you dont really need to be taking a class or taking a course or being in that data storage system to be able to get this information and understand it the ai agent with the right access and with the right power can get that for you and then also summarize it in a way that make the most sense because it can understand how to explain it to different type of persona so i think thats to me one of the most powerful but also pragmatic way to use ai yeah thats interesting of course it make if you look at our customer landscape it make a lot of sense because a lot of our customer come from this operation or service desk environment right so they have different l1 l2 l3 type of responsibility and depending on their level they will be dealing with information a you said in a very different way or different or different,Creating an agentic AI framework for observability
6,6_3,of responsibility and depending on their level they will be dealing with information a you said in a very different way or different or different complexity of information is getting to them so ai agent can help them decide for them or simplify them for you for them okay thats great so let get into a little bit of the world that we live in and that is it operation and tell u a little bit about how do these agent ai or ai agent will help specifically enhance this it operation role yeah of course so the ai agent that im building within itam are ai agent that collaborate autonomously with third party ai agent from best of breed observability platform and so the problem that were trying to solve is that when an it operator is trying to triage and investigate an alert they really need to understand very quickly what is the impact and severity of this alert and which team and subject matter expert can they pull in to start the investigation and the complexity is that the critical,Creating an agentic AI framework for observability
6,6_4,severity of this alert and which team and subject matter expert can they pull in to start the investigation and the complexity is that the critical information to answer these two question resides in information silo it resides within service now but it also most elusively it resides in third party observability tool and to make the problem worse these it operator they dont often have access to these tool and when they do the learning curve for these tool is very high right theyre not built for it operator with more limited technical knowledge and so with ai agent you can sort of like break the barrier of access first of all because these ai agent can automatically contact a lot of these best of breed tool and they can also simplify the information and present it in a way thats very operatorfriendly and so with access to the information understanding and context of the information they can very quickly understand impact and severity a well a get enough like nugget of knowledge to,Creating an agentic AI framework for observability
6,6_5,understanding and context of the information they can very quickly understand impact and severity a well a get enough like nugget of knowledge to start the investigation with the subject matter expert yeah so i mean this is great because a lot of time when we talking to customer they just dont have one two or three tool theyve had sometimes half a dozen or even sometimes it doesnt tool right and it open more environment when youre monitoring your apps your microservices you probably have open source tool so it just help them right because it becomes almost a manager of manager kind of approach for a lot of work thats what itom doe today we embrace like an open system open ecosystem of observability and monitoring vendor we already connect with them via event management they can now set they can send event and alert into itom and from there thats sort of the entry point for the it operator and our agentic approach is exactly the same right in the world of ai agent we want to be the,Creating an agentic AI framework for observability
6,6_6,there thats sort of the entry point for the it operator and our agentic approach is exactly the same right in the world of ai agent we want to be the manager of the manager of ai agent we want to be the agent of agent and we want to help the it operator connect all of these vendor and to be able to facilitate a collaboration amongst ai agent and it doesnt really matter how the other agent the other third party agent are built right i mean they could be using their own llm they could be using their own data structure what matter is the data that come to service now is that the right yeah exactly and i think also to add on to that the information that they provide is very harmonious with the information that we already have so we can take the information that they have based off of like triceps log and metric and combine that harmoniously with the information that we have within the cmdb and sort of like the workflow and post mortems and like previous incident and alert and we can marry,Creating an agentic AI framework for observability
6,6_7,the information that we have within the cmdb and sort of like the workflow and post mortems and like previous incident and alert and we can marry that together and give the operator sort of like the best suggestion on what the next step should be yeah there also this brings up a good topic you mentioned cmdb so cmdb is a great way for becoming a providing a system of record for a lot of enterprise today but even if you dont have a great cmdb today or youre still in the process of building a quality cmdb this approach can still work right i mean they dont have to be bound down to say that you know i need to get my cmdb like 70 to ready state exactly it pretty much decoupled yeah and i think i mentioned this very briefly in the beginning that whole data strategy the service now ha around work for data fabric and the rapridb which is kind of pretty advanced way of processing your data that also help because you know we are not bound to a specific data structure or a specific format it,Creating an agentic AI framework for observability
6,6_8,of pretty advanced way of processing your data that also help because you know we are not bound to a specific data structure or a specific format it could be able to format it could be done in a any way that we can ingest that information into service now so then we also call it a knowledge graph which is kind of another way of thinking about how the relationship are built so thats great let go a little bit into do you want to give u specific scenario you know you are working right now in the middle of this huge development and we will see that our development being released in the coming month but if you take a specific use case do you want to walk down a specific use case with what youre building with some of the other agent yeah and so yeah and i think it always help to anchor around a very concrete use case and so the one that you know we see a lot when we work with a lot of ecommerce company enterprise company is that for example the alert that come into itom will first be say on,Creating an agentic AI framework for observability
6,6_9,we see a lot when we work with a lot of ecommerce company enterprise company is that for example the alert that come into itom will first be say on a application service called the payment service and so it the operator job to sort of understand when they see this alert for the payment service say it like the sla for availability is breached right normally it should be 95 it now 94 and so the operator really in a world without ai agent they need to figure out whats the impact and severity of the alert and who to pull in to start the investigation and so with ai agent now the operator can open now assist and automatically we can detect that okay this alert is from vendor xyz but given we have an integration with them our ai agent will just autonomously reach out to their ai agent to say hey can you tell u more about the alert what other entity are you seeing being impacted do you have supporting metric to sort of like support that claim do you see any thing that might have caused that,Creating an agentic AI framework for observability
6,6_10,are you seeing being impacted do you have supporting metric to sort of like support that claim do you see any thing that might have caused that change recent deploys configuration change and this is all information that we can get in real time to help this operator figure out so can i snooze or do i really need to go deeper into this investigation for the payment service yeah i think thats a great use case because that come up a lot right in our customer who are doing real time transaction and they need to make sure that there no anomaly or they can stay ahead of a little bit of anomaly thats coming up it a lot of rich data thats out there but also talk a little bit about this go back to more of an ai ops kind of workflow to write once we get all this rich data were able to freeogit were able to present it to a customer in a more this could be an element of autonomous aspect versus assisted aspect can you talk a little bit about where doe autonomous or of ai agent could come in versus,Creating an agentic AI framework for observability
6,6_11,be an element of autonomous aspect versus assisted aspect can you talk a little bit about where doe autonomous or of ai agent could come in versus assisted yeah i think we want to give that control to the customer themselves so you can see this in sort of like different layer of autonomy the first layer maybe the most conservative is that the ai agent is just presenting a recommendation so it not really acting on it but it giving the operator enough information to say hey this is what this is my guidance kind of take it or leave it but a we get more complex and integrated with action that either agent can take on behalf of the user the user can also in their configuration set it to something less conservative so not only is the ai agent telling them what is the rationale for next step it also implementing those next step and you can see the most liberal would be it acting on your behalf and it just giving you a conclusion of what it did in the last sort of day or two and so with the,Creating an agentic AI framework for observability
6,6_12,the most liberal would be it acting on your behalf and it just giving you a conclusion of what it did in the last sort of day or two and so with the first release we definitely want to tread carefully we know ai agent are new people are cautious there fear of hallucination we really just want to summarize and give them the rationale for what is the conclusion that ha been made and then a we launch more more and more agent we feel a lot more comfortable in age two or 2026 we can sort of ladder up those capability awesome yeah that make sense all right so a we get towards the end of this podcast how are customer can keep up to date and even if they want to get involved in this new development what can they do yeah i would say that we are you know we have blog we have update from the sort of normal service now channel a were rolling out more and more ai agent across all of the use not just ai ops and item and definitely if you are interested in being a design partner we would love to,Creating an agentic AI framework for observability
6,6_13,more and more ai agent across all of the use not just ai ops and item and definitely if you are interested in being a design partner we would love to work with you to sort of figure out what is your use case and how we can build ai agent to solve your problem reduce mttr in your behalf awesome this wa just a kind of very snippet small snippet of what were working on and were going to bring you more of these kind of episode that you can get up to speed on also you can go to servicenowcom our main page is loaded with not a lot of new use case that we are working on youll get you up to speed and danika thank you for being here today and were going to get you back here soon when you have some agent out there working for our customer but yeah thanks a lot for being here thanks for everyone for listening in until the next episode bye for now thank you,Creating an agentic AI framework for observability
7,7_0,hi everyone welcome to another episode of the podcast im your host bobby brill and today were going to speak with the multimedia team the team that creates the multimedia bit the video and some of the infographics and all the graphic you see on the dock page and the youtube channel and our community channel that content that help you learn how service now work and were going to talk with macy douglas and dana haynes and im going to chime in myself a im on the multimedia team and were going to talk about how we make all that content to scale a quickly and efficiently and a perfect a possible for you the customer so dana tell u a little bit about your role here and all that you do to create a lot of the content we see well i help manage a vendor program where we are working with a third party vendor to help u create video and then also i run a program where we are training technical writer how to design visual content for their documentation page also macy im going to talk to you a well,Creating Multimedia Content at Scale with AI
7,7_1,a program where we are training technical writer how to design visual content for their documentation page also macy im going to talk to you a well but first introduce yourself and tell u a little bit about your role here okay my name is macy douglas and im a manager on the multimedia team ive been working with dana for the last seven year but ive been a part of service now for almost eight year now your expertise really is in the management and the workflow and youve got a really heavy strong knowledge of service now talk a little bit about how that came about since ive been with service now for almost eight year a lot of it ha come naturally just from working on various video on different product throughout the time of my eight year here ive been here since the helsinki release and one thing that i did here at service now wa i got really interested in the development of at the time it wa the drink your own champagne campaign we did internally and i kind of took our video asset,Creating Multimedia Content at Scale with AI
7,7_2,really interested in the development of at the time it wa the drink your own champagne campaign we did internally and i kind of took our video asset management that wa on a spreadsheet and put it onto service now so that really also just the self teaching that really helped me learn a lot about the service now platform itself and my name is bobby brill and ive been a video producer for the last 15 year and here now at service now im what we call a content producer so were helping to create the video develop the voice over program and help to create a visual representation of what the writer are putting down in the dock page a another learning tool to help solve customer issue so that they can use the product efficiently and effectively so macy give u a walk through on how were building video content because it not a simple a just setting up a camera and recording it a little bit different correct it actually the exact opposite we dont use any kind of camera to record anything all of,Creating Multimedia Content at Scale with AI
7,7_3,up a camera and recording it a little bit different correct it actually the exact opposite we dont use any kind of camera to record anything all of our video are done on the product itself we use we do screen demo product recording at least for this year our goal is to create over 400 piece of content whether thats a video an infographic or what we call procedure video 400 video thats a herkyl and feed so our customer really love video they want to see visual example in our documentation it something that theyre consistently asking for so macy walk u through a really the person who helping to push the content forward and helping to develop workflow and bringing all the piece together those little intricacy that help u to make the best multimedia content possible so the multimedia team is kind of like an inhouse video production team with the added benefit of we know service now so we produce content exclusively for the product documentation site and we also publish our content to the,Creating Multimedia Content at Scale with AI
7,7_4,the added benefit of we know service now so we produce content exclusively for the product documentation site and we also publish our content to the service now documentation youtube channel our team is made up of script writer who have a more traditional maybe they have a traditional background in writing or learning and then we have content producer who have a traditional background in video editing audio production video like live video production animation and then we have people on the team that are a little bit of both which is like which is something that dana specializes in shes really good at both thing so what we do is we create the video and infographics that help explain the various product that service now offer those get put on the documentation page and then like i said pushed out to youtube a well our goal this year is to create over 400 piece of content so whether that be we do infographics we do video that are around three to five minute that kind of explain an,Creating Multimedia Content at Scale with AI
7,7_5,is to create over 400 piece of content so whether that be we do infographics we do video that are around three to five minute that kind of explain an overview of a product or maybe show you how to get started with it and then we also do procedure video which are short less than a minute video that demonstrate a quick task on a task page on the documentation so it showing you maybe 10 step of how to configure something or set something up so getting that content into a video script we have a lot of way of doing that is there any tool that were using that help u to create faster and at scalable and also kind of stay on tone ill talk specific to procedure video so again those are short one minute video that demonstrate a procedure on a task page in our documentation and typically the way those are written is it very like create to create a new page you create this select that submit this and then youre done it very straightforward so to get the right tone for our video and to match a,Creating Multimedia Content at Scale with AI
7,7_6,a new page you create this select that submit this and then youre done it very straightforward so to get the right tone for our video and to match a more casual empathetic human tone for a voiceover were using tool like gemini or writer and sometimes even copilot we can continue to prompt it until we get a voiceover tone that match something that were trying to put in our video so instead of select this new page we might want to say select this page so you can create your new team workspace one of the thing that weve been doing a lot more of the past couple of year is working closer with the technical the documentation writer and but we really put them in a place of hey youre the expert and can you teach me quickly because im not going to go spend hour and hour researching this and learning exactly how to do it so if they can teach me quickly i can put that into a script im just mirroring what theyre giving to me one thing ive seen with those tool is like the gemini or copilot is they,Creating Multimedia Content at Scale with AI
7,7_7,i can put that into a script im just mirroring what theyre giving to me one thing ive seen with those tool is like the gemini or copilot is they lean more towards like the marketing side which we really try to avoid and it help a lot when were prompting the tool they hey i want this to be 90 technical and 10 friendly and i find like that those number right there even though it sound super skewed towards the technical it is just sweet spot for our script but ai tool ha so much context a to how customer are using a product or why they even are purchasing the product to begin with and having that little bit of background information really help write the script using writer and gemini tool like those help really help u get the script to a point where we need it to be to create a voiceover but honestly bobbi i feel like youre more of the expert and you could speak more to that and how youre using writer or gemini or any other ai tool to create script from technical documentation page it,Creating Multimedia Content at Scale with AI
7,7_8,and you could speak more to that and how youre using writer or gemini or any other ai tool to create script from technical documentation page it fascinating when you use these tool from a video producer stan point and dana i think youll agree with this well were always working on time were always working on how long is this going to take how long doe this much dialogue actually equate to in minute on screen and so these tool have been great for u to take something technical which may be worthy because youre not reading it but now youre going to hear it and were able to use these tool to make it concise make it friendly sometimes were having to add more friendly thing at the end of the video and try it out or thing that help make the voiceover feel like a guiding voice along with giving you the answer you need because it such a it a fun way to now make video now it new that youre creating on the fly well how do you do that how do you youre using a computer generated voice how do you,Creating Multimedia Content at Scale with AI
7,7_9,way to now make video now it new that youre creating on the fly well how do you do that how do you youre using a computer generated voice how do you make that sound friendly and appealing to somebody it pretty fascinating how good the tool have been so like im literally sitting in a voiceover booth with all the voiceover thing to do voiceover but now were using ai tool to make that consistent and once you start using these ai tool and finding the right tweak a were all finding with all these ai tool were getting the tone we like were getting those inflection were getting not so much drama but were getting the really warm and fuzzy guiding tone that we like and that really help bring a level of consistency to the content so that when youre watching maybe a series of video you can feel confident that what youre hearing and what youre being told is the right answer and one of the tool were using well said really weve been working with them a bit to help tweak that out and really get,Creating Multimedia Content at Scale with AI
7,7_10,told is the right answer and one of the tool were using well said really weve been working with them a bit to help tweak that out and really get these sound and rendering of our terminology and our acronym so that it sound like youre having that guiding voice with you at all time when we look at it from a video perspective voiceover and music were kind of that icing on the cake where if it wa a training video you should be able to follow along and the music and the voiceover wa there to ensure that you were getting a high quality product but now when we think about thing like accessibility and having that guide with u it make it so much better to have a good voice consistently and easy to adjust later a through the process maybe the step change weve got the ability to give our customer everything they need to have success with this maybe only a one minute video you said youve been working with well said weve and we have implemented well said for two year now it ha been your favorite,Creating Multimedia Content at Scale with AI
7,7_11,only a one minute video you said youve been working with well said weve and we have implemented well said for two year now it ha been your favorite change with that tool because a we know thing are like evolving so quickly i think the biggest change in using well said and now that were in using an ai tool is just the speed of being able to update the copy a it were because our script are always changing the release date is always changing the content and the step may change a the developer and the writer change it we can go back in and still stay on tone and feeling by just removing line here and there from the script and updating that it make it very seamless when we deliver thats the biggest change in using a tool like well said or any ai tool from when we were using human voiceover a somebody who done voiceover you do it in the morning it sound different than it doe in the afternoon and if youre sick there are those subtle tweak that can slow down production and when were trying,Creating Multimedia Content at Scale with AI
7,7_12,it sound different than it doe in the afternoon and if youre sick there are those subtle tweak that can slow down production and when were trying our best to get a much useful information out to the customer quickly a possible we need that consistency and we need that speed i remember recording voiceover they see remember when we would sit in the room there would be three of u one wa that person that wa actually doing the dialogue and then we had one person that wa in charge of recording and then the other person that would watch the script and make sure the word are being said correctly i remember one time like my stomach wa just growling and we had to like rerecord stuff over and over and im like oh sorry and thats if i hit my mic oh man we screwed it up weve got to go all the way back again and youre getting in that flow of doing thing that it can be difficult within the department were all working together we can reach out to each other we have our tool that we can use and we can,Creating Multimedia Content at Scale with AI
7,7_13,that it can be difficult within the department were all working together we can reach out to each other we have our tool that we can use and we can change thing on the fly but like many production house youre working with one of our vendor and helping to guide and empower some of our vendor to use the tool were using to then stay on brand and stay consistent and deliver additional product can you walk u through how that ha worked not only just with the ai tool but in general how thats changed in the last few year a weve developed a better relationship and workflow with our vendor well when were working with the vendor it very interesting in these dynamic that we have i mean the three of u work together where a team we can reach out and actually working with the vendor is very very similar they are truly an extension of our team we meet chris another guy on our team we meet with the vendor one to week and we just see where were at i mean truly i dont like to use the word it like family,Creating Multimedia Content at Scale with AI

9,9_0,youre listening to accelerate a service now podcast series about achieving your business outcome where we talk about how to get the most value from the now platform hey everyone this is crystal clevver and this is deidrease wear your host and excited to talk to you about servicenow value acceleration solution that include expert service training and impact it give me great pleasure to welcome mike brickner to the show today hi mick hi crystal thanks for having me thank you for being here so why dont you tell me what your role at servicenow entail sure so im a service offering manager in our customer outcome function and specifically i help and manage our service portfolio for our expert service or professional service organization and my role entail designing building launching optimizing and improving and just managing the lifecycle of the different service that our expert service function delivers and our consultant deliver so thats helping identify opportunity for service that are,Service offerings to help your organization achieve its business needs
9,9_1,the different service that our expert service function delivers and our consultant deliver so thats helping identify opportunity for service that are going to bring value to our customer bringing together the different expert across the company to help design and build and then launch those service and then there a continual service improvement aspect of this too where were reviewing service and the different engagement of those service and just looking for opportunity to optimize and improve those service and just bring more value to customer through expert service very good thank you for that so i imagine that there are different type of service youre responsible for can you tell me a little bit more and tell me how theyre categorized yeah when we talk about our service offering and our portfolio of service we typically break them down into three main category so there implementation service advisory service and then optimization and remediation service and we have example of,Service offerings to help your organization achieve its business needs
9,9_2,down into three main category so there implementation service advisory service and then optimization and remediation service and we have example of varying size and scope of offering in each of those category okay so let just start with implementation service and if you could expand on what they are who theyre designed for and what they consist of yeah implementation service are probably our most common service it typically what customer are looking for at some point in their service now journey and probably the most common type of service that our expert deliver it helping customer enable a new solution or maybe expand an existing service now solution that theyre already using but are looking to kind of take it to the next level and these implementation service is really how you get to value right helping enable and deploy service now application on platform and in your instance these are often for net new customer so customer that are new to the platform implementing thing for the,Service offerings to help your organization achieve its business needs
9,9_3,application on platform and in your instance these are often for net new customer so customer that are new to the platform implementing thing for the first time but also existing customer who are expanding on the platform maybe to other workflow area or adopting or implementing more advanced application and process so it really applies across all customer and at some point in your service now journey might need help implementing right and they probably apply to all of our workflow i presume right yeah we have example of service for all of our workflow across the category so if you were to pick one that you could go a little bit deeper on which one would that be in the implementation service area yeah one example that id love to talk about is called implementation design it a newer service and that we put a lot of effort into designing and launching relatively recently this one not a full implementation service instead it focus on understanding the customer desired outcome and then,Service offerings to help your organization achieve its business needs
9,9_4,and launching relatively recently this one not a full implementation service instead it focus on understanding the customer desired outcome and then designing a solution using all the platform capability available a well a like leading practice and design practice to essentially create a design that the customer can take with them and then implement either with expert service or with a partner or maybe they self implement and there multiple reason why customer are looking for a service that focus on the design activity first and only and one could be that they have unclear design requirement or scope so it would be hard to try and estimate like what a full implementation would look like what it would cost the duration of it so you can kind of take a modular approach and start with the requirement and the design first and thats really kind of a key use case and then the customer would have a good understanding of the required investment level and the effort that would go into,Service offerings to help your organization achieve its business needs
9,9_5,kind of a key use case and then the customer would have a good understanding of the required investment level and the effort that would go into configuring and implementing that design and this design could apply to any workflow or most workflow that we support today right yes this is one service that applies across all of our workflow so if you can think of an application or a capability in any of the workflow then we have workshop and other activity a part of this offering to help design a solution using those capability okay that make sense you also mentioned advisory service right and whats the difference between those and implementation service because i presume that when you sell and when you deliver an implementation service you do advise our customer so whats the difference for people who dont know yeah thats definitely true our implementation service typically include some aspect of advisory session enablement that sort of thing advisory service are more of like a standalone,Service offerings to help your organization achieve its business needs
9,9_6,implementation service typically include some aspect of advisory session enablement that sort of thing advisory service are more of like a standalone advisory service so they usually include like some sort of assessment that could be like a manual assessment where a consultant go in and review your instance customer instance and come up with recommendation it could be an automated assessment using something like our health scan tool or script sometimes it a little bit of both kind of leveraging both automated and like a manual assessment and then based on the assessment advisory service will always include recommendation based on leading practice so youll get finding from that assessment and then specific recommendation based on those finding and thats typically where the advisory service stop we dont take the next step to actually implement on those recommendation and on those finding but those finding and the recommendation are all kind of packaged up for the customer to take the,Service offerings to help your organization achieve its business needs
9,9_7,on those recommendation and on those finding but those finding and the recommendation are all kind of packaged up for the customer to take the next step with that make sense so you mentioned using our health scan tool for example but are there other specific service you can talk about or maybe one that would be of interest to our audience today yeah we have a few in this area and some are product specific one thats near and dear to my heart because i have a background in service catalog and service portfolio and it service management is a service called service catalog unified and again this is an advisory service so it includes an assessment of essentially a customer service catalog and request management posture and maturity and a consultant will come in and do an assessment mostly a manual assessment looking at the different catalog item and like the health of your request management process and the nice thing about this one and the reason it called service catalog unified is,Service offerings to help your organization achieve its business needs
9,9_8,item and like the health of your request management process and the nice thing about this one and the reason it called service catalog unified is because theyll not only look at the catalog item and the workflow and request you have in your service now instance but also those that you might have in another tool or on another platform in your environment with the goal of bringing together recommendation and consolidating all of those catalog item or workflow on your service now instance and create like a one stop shop for request fulfillment so to facilitate that there also workshop that are included a part of this service they focus on service catalog and request management process a you can imagine and there also demo that the consultant will provide around different service catalog tool like catalog builder flow designer employee center and those are all tailored based on the finding of the assessment and basically the maturity and posture of your service catalog process so for,Service offerings to help your organization achieve its business needs
9,9_9,and those are all tailored based on the finding of the assessment and basically the maturity and posture of your service catalog process so for example if the finding suggest that using order guide would be like a great way to bring together a bunch of related catalog item and workflow that might be spread out across your environment then well take extra time to focus on order guide a part of those platform demo and basically enable the customer on that tool that capability that application so that they can take those finding and act on them and this one typically a seven week engagement and again you walk away with those finding and recommendation for next step along with the enablement through the workshop and the platform demo well you must have read my mind because i wa wondering how long your service typically take so this one is seven week so one you mentioned before implementation design i presume it varies depending on the workflow it doe it varies by workflow and because of,Service offerings to help your organization achieve its business needs
9,9_10,week so one you mentioned before implementation design i presume it varies depending on the workflow it doe it varies by workflow and because of kind of the modular nature of that one there multiple tier a well so every workflow ha one im sorry two to four tier available depending on the number of workshop and application and process that you want to cover and design for that make sense so it going to vary the amount of time you spend where the customer is going to vary based on the workflow and the tier that they chose yep exactly right and last but not least you mentioned optimization and remediation service a the last category what are those service yeah optimization and remediation service are similar to advisory service they kind of fall in between implementation and advisory in a way so typically those start with again some sort of assessment thats focused on identifying improvement opportunity and then helping define a backlog of of those improvement opportunity or development,Service offerings to help your organization achieve its business needs
9,9_11,assessment thats focused on identifying improvement opportunity and then helping define a backlog of of those improvement opportunity or development task that would need to be carried out to remediate or optimize a solution and then typically you get time with one of the consultant to do handson remediation and optimization so the consultant will work with the customer based on that backlog that they define and take a set amount of those story and the consultant will actually help implement configure those story and those solution a part of the engagement itself so it like advisory with kind of an implementation yeah both of that yeah so it like a hybrid a little bit right between advisory and implementation you just take the advisory a little bit farther absolutely okay is there one specific service you can talk to me about that fall in this category yeah probably our flagship service in this category is one called cmdb amplified it another product specific offering that focus on,Service offerings to help your organization achieve its business needs
9,9_12,in this category yeah probably our flagship service in this category is one called cmdb amplified it another product specific offering that focus on cmdb and related process and application and tool this one start again with an indepth assessment the consultant come in and look at the health of your cmdb and they also use the cmdb data foundation dashboard a kind of a mean to help them assess but also to enable the customer because you can use that dashboard to kind of monitor the ongoing health of your cmdb and track your progress and maturity using that dashboard so you get enabled on the dashboard along with the assessment then youll work to prioritize kind of the key finding and like those remediation story it also includes workshop and coaching much like an advisory service would so with cmdb amplified you get workshop on cmdb governance there workshop on our common service data model which is an important thing to understand along with cmdb and then you get the remediation so,Service offerings to help your organization achieve its business needs
9,9_13,there workshop on our common service data model which is an important thing to understand along with cmdb and then you get the remediation so essentially the configuration or implementation of a subset of your remediation story and for cmdb amplified you actually get 20 hour of remediation time with a service now consultant so whatever story make the most sense to implement and leverage our service now consultant for in those 20 hour that thats what you can can walk away with along with all the other kind of prioritize story this one also a seven week engagement so similar to service catalog unified you walk away with the remediation the prioritize story and a little more enablement and understanding of cmdb and the dashboard that you can use so finally what would you recommend to someone who is interested in learning more about all of these service you talked about yeah the most important thing for u is that our customer get to value and can effectively enable all the platform,Service offerings to help your organization achieve its business needs
9,9_14,of these service you talked about yeah the most important thing for u is that our customer get to value and can effectively enable all the platform capability to solve for their business objective and desired outcome i think the best thing for you to do if youre interested in expert service or any of the offering that i mentioned today or anything in our portfolio is to reach out to your account exec they can put you in touch with your service account executive who can help advise on which service might make sense provide more detail on maybe a specific offering that you had in mind perfect well mick thank you so much for your time really appreciate it this wa very informative thank you so much im crystal clevver and im de drees and this is the servicenow accelerate podcast series you can find u and other servicenow podcasts at the servicenow community at communityservicenowcom be sure to follow u in your favorite podcast apps so you dont miss our next episode,Service offerings to help your organization achieve its business needs
10,10_0,hello im cat finch and welcome to the latest episode of the service now uk night executive circle podcast series within our podcast we speak to some of the industry most exciting innovator thought leader and senior executive all with the aim of giving you our listener the inspiration insight and market intelligence you need to help drive your organisation forward this week were speaking to gina gill the chief strategy officer for the cabinet officer the digital and data office welcome gina thank you very much im delighted to be here now in this role that youve obviously been in for a few month you are focusing on the new government digital strategy and delivering of transformation i wa really keen and interested in what you were saying about building the strategy the building the foundation sorry for this digital future for government in your view whats critical to the foundation that youre building so i think that relates to the reason that i moved to the centre in the first place so,Digital & AI transformation in the Public Sector
10,10_1,your view whats critical to the foundation that youre building so i think that relates to the reason that i moved to the centre in the first place so there were two reason that i moved the first wa i couldnt see where we were going a government digital and data so i couldnt see the vision that brings u all together were over 20000 people working across many different government department and then if you add health and local authority into that then that number get much much much bigger and i couldnt get a sense of what were collectively trying to do so i felt like we were building some great digital service and isolation but actually not necessarily solving that endtoend user experience across different department across different service across different agency so that wa reason number one having that clarity of where were going and then number two wa thing that we have called system reform i hate the name but it thing that slow down or prevent digital delivery within department so,Digital & AI transformation in the Public Sector
10,10_2,number two wa thing that we have called system reform i hate the name but it thing that slow down or prevent digital delivery within department so you know thing that if you speak if you speak to a hundred colleague the list the kind of same thing that are frustrating and those are thing that i think the centre is best placed to resolve and ha to resolve and it thing like money and incentive so how we fund digital work which isnt really aligned to digital delivery and it doesnt help u to deliver in our way it is much more aligned to kind of big infrastructure not technology infrastructure but big infrastructure project and program and big waterfall program so thats an issue for people incentive i think is the other thing so i dont think we incentivise department to work together so how do we how might we resolve that so if youre having some interest in conversation for the treasury about that and thinking about about thing we might be able to do in that space and related to that is,Digital & AI transformation in the Public Sector
10,10_3,some interest in conversation for the treasury about that and thinking about about thing we might be able to do in that space and related to that is you know we talk about efficiency a lot but again we dont we talk about efficiency within kind of a department or an agency budget not across the system and lot of and i think lot of the efficiency that we need to create is across the system so you know you think about justice the cost of recidivism is 18 billion pound a year that doesnt sit in an individual department budget right thats the cost to uk plc how do you get after that how do you create the incentive to get after that so thats money and incentive the second area from use capability and i dont mean capability within digital and data colleague i think you know weve been weve made weve made quite a lot of really good inroad into that but more broadly i think there still a lack of understanding of what digital mean across the civil service and across senior leader in the civil,Digital & AI transformation in the Public Sector
10,10_4,that but more broadly i think there still a lack of understanding of what digital mean across the civil service and across senior leader in the civil service i think we still see it a a back office function we still see it a a cost space and we dont really see it a frontline delivery and a lot of it is now frontline delivery and so there something about how do we change how do we help to help people to like unbetter understand digital and how it can enable a different way of delivering service and then last but not least is how we buy thing and work with industry were still very and weve got lot of kind of different framework we did gclide but we still predominantly work with the same really big supplier we dont we havent done a well a we would have wanted to i dont think in term of working with smaller with like smes with smaller supplier with people who might have new and innovative technology that might help to build better experience and i think there a real opportunity in that,Digital & AI transformation in the Public Sector
10,10_5,with people who might have new and innovative technology that might help to build better experience and i think there a real opportunity in that space a well and a real opportunity to think about how do we go from innovate like how do we go from kind of testing thing to then actually kind of full on delivery without running you know many many procurement process lengthy procurement process along the way definitely so it sound like part of your strategy when the initial stage is going to be a bit of an internal change management piece like so that kind of cultural mindset shift to thinking about how digital can align a lot of these different government department i think that shared service the interoperability between all the piece really need to come together to overcome some of the legacy technology and the silo that exist is that going to be part of your strategy that were trying to do so it would definitely be part of the strategy and i mean what were talking about is cultural,Digital & AI transformation in the Public Sector
10,10_6,to be part of your strategy that were trying to do so it would definitely be part of the strategy and i mean what were talking about is cultural change right and cultural change across an organisation a system that ha been in place for a very long time so thats not fast and it not easy but i think we have to say a really clear picture of where were going we have to say i kind of what the next kind of three to five year will hold and then we have to talk about those kind of foundational piece and what were going to do to address those over that period a well so with the new government encouraging the notion of doing more with less and using technology to improve efficiency there is a real need to not just build that longer term digital strategy that is robust but remain agile and respond to the political the economical and technological change that are inevitable and that are happening a we speak yeah look at it hard it hard and it hard in a system where where we know that every five,Digital & AI transformation in the Public Sector
10,10_7,change that are inevitable and that are happening a we speak yeah look at it hard it hard and it hard in a system where where we know that every five or three year well have a potential in a new government in a different direction so i think we need to separate where were going long term and set out a clear long term vision and that ha to be something that is hard to work with and so i think it ha to be grounded in service and public service and i think it ha to be grounded in the user experience that we wanted to create for member of the public and for business and so that could be thing like that could be thing like we dont want people to have to share their data same data with u all for another again it could be thing like we want interaction to be simpler we want interaction to be seamless we dont want people to need to understand which department theyre interacting with or which service or form they need so i think you can set up that picture of if this is what we want it to look,Digital & AI transformation in the Public Sector
10,10_8,department theyre interacting with or which service or form they need so i think you can set up that picture of if this is what we want it to look and feel like in the future and then work with each government to look at how you prioritize which service you focus on during that particular period so for this government for example it might be planning so aligned to the mission for growth so i think it yes set out the long term thats hard to argue with the kind of transcends political party and election and then use kind of each new term to focus on the priority of the government at the time it a really difficult balance isnt it between the people that youre working with and how to make that shift and change in government to really what citizen expect theyve got apps theyre using tiktok they are digital first digital native and theyve got lot of idea and they dont want to sit on a phone anymore they dont want to talk to a virtual agent anymore sorry a call center agent anymore so in,Digital & AI transformation in the Public Sector
10,10_9,lot of idea and they dont want to sit on a phone anymore they dont want to talk to a virtual agent anymore sorry a call center agent anymore so in your view what technology do you think is needed to try and get that balance what the milestone is the kind of build forward so i actually try not to think about technology because i think technology change so quickly that were in danger of saying were in danger of setting out a strategy that say yeah were going to use this particular technology to reach this goal i think we really need to focus on outcome and i worry that in the past we kind of go through phase of different buzzword and when i first landed in government it wa rpa so you know robotic process automation i wa a reddit a strategy i wa at meeting a few month ago where they were talking about robot and i genuinely thought they meant physical robot until i realized they meant they didnt mean physical robot at all we were talking about robotic automation and you know and a you,Digital & AI transformation in the Public Sector
10,10_10,physical robot until i realized they meant they didnt mean physical robot at all we were talking about robotic automation and you know and a you know over the past euro say ai is on a the word on everyones lip and i think that if we get too caught up in the technology we ended up we end up implementing technology for technology sake potentially putting lipstick on a peg and not actually solving the problem that we say out to solve like when jenny i burst onto the scene i wa at the moj at the time and i would get people emailing me from like that i had never met before in your organization ive got a great idea here i think we should do this from an ai perspective you know we can do like ai prison visit i dont even understand what that mean so yeah so i think we have to really kind of make sure that people get excited about the problem that theyre solving and not about the technology i completely agree i had a fantastic conversation with sally ann hick shes the global vp automation,Digital & AI transformation in the Public Sector
10,10_11,that theyre solving and not about the technology i completely agree i had a fantastic conversation with sally ann hick shes the global vp automation experience and shes a huge advocate for focusing on the business outcome first the challenge that youre trying and actually ai might not always be the natural answer to the question there is a journey there an evolution of what youre trying to achieve based on what those challenge are and speaking of challenge and the foundation youre trying to put in place do you see reskilling and upskilling and then the general digital skill piece ha a challenge or a bit of an opportunity with your team and your department i think it an opportunity and i think look the excitement so the one thing that ai ha done is it opened the door to many conversation that we werent having before which is a good thing and i think that that help u then to have conversation about skill and when we last spoke i talked about the fact that that doesnt mean that we need,Digital & AI transformation in the Public Sector
10,10_12,and i think that that help u then to have conversation about skill and when we last spoke i talked about the fact that that doesnt mean that we need to turn everyone into a techie for a format i think it much more about having the skill to be able to operate in a digital age which really is an age of change constant change and so it about being able to work with people with different skill set it about being able to really focus on what is the problem that were trying to solve and what is the experience of the user thats using the service it much more about the ability to think literally to solve problem and the desire to understand how other people are solving problem i think and kind of trying to bring some of that back into government exactly there a lot more just to skill it more about the digital literacy how do you interpret the data how do you i mean ive seen job role advertised for ai prompter so people are actually working out what do i need to prompt ai to get the,Digital & AI transformation in the Public Sector
10,10_13,the data how do you i mean ive seen job role advertised for ai prompter so people are actually working out what do i need to prompt ai to get the information out and thats a skill in itself i think we have to not ignore the human intelligence that go with the artificial intelligence and there is a skill to that there a skill to being the human in the loop to make sure that youre using the technology in the right way absolutely and there an interesting debate about actually do we end up with human skill that are actrifying because were replacing them with technology so people lose the ability to bring that human lens and how to keep the right balance and i think cddo ha been working on a framework for where ai shouldnt be used or how to think about where to use ai particularly generative ai and we had the same kind of linked at the ministry of justice and it wa in some case it wa specific to different business area so for example in court it an absolute red line in term of,Digital & AI transformation in the Public Sector
10,10_14,the ministry of justice and it wa in some case it wa specific to different business area so for example in court it an absolute red line in term of technologymaking judgment thats just not a line were willing to cross and therefore it i guess relatively easy in that space to say this is where the line is i think it actually harder in other space to say this is where the line is but those are the conversation we need to be having i think it introduced sort of touched there on a little bit of almost like a bit of a digital divide and not losing the human skill that we have if we rely solely on technology actually you could see they talk about thing like ai and technology being able to bring that digital divide together but there also an opportunity to challenge the earth a bit of a fear that it could expand that divide because like we all use the calculator and im terrible at mental arithmetic we dont want to lose the ability that we have just because we then become solely reliant on,Digital & AI transformation in the Public Sector
10,10_15,use the calculator and im terrible at mental arithmetic we dont want to lose the ability that we have just because we then become solely reliant on technology absolutely i think thats a real progress definitely i think another area thats interesting with this sort of human and the artificial intelligence is the sort of the bias around ai i dont know if youve seen the latest tv advert with dove i dont know i havent actually it really powerful because they sort of type in to the chat but give me a photo of a beautiful woman and so of course it generates what it think is a beautiful woman and then you can put in the information say give me an image of what is a dove beautiful woman and thats when you get back the image and their different size different colour and it suddenly becomes more representative and i think there is a fear though on what that bias is if we dont put in the right data especially for you i think with that customer first mentality and looking at your citizen,Digital & AI transformation in the Public Sector
10,10_16,on what that bias is if we dont put in the right data especially for you i think with that customer first mentality and looking at your citizen experience you have to get that data right you dont want to put anything bias into your system because youre then going to be getting the right user experience out absolutely agree but i also think that there is so much data that sits across government that is it subjective because again going back to m o j case note and i say just damage in health adult are case note so there lot of that type of information in data that sits in government and you need to that information and that information will likely have some level of bias in it because a human we all have a level of bias so it about how do you make sure that youre not amplifying that bias and i think thats hard and i think we only find that by experimenting safely but experimenting to see what level of kind of accuracy we get when we test ai in different scenario and then we have to make,Digital & AI transformation in the Public Sector
10,10_17,by experimenting safely but experimenting to see what level of kind of accuracy we get when we test ai in different scenario and then we have to make decision on whether that level of accuracy is good enough and whether it good enough for public service particularly definitely i think thats where ai ha a very positive force it creating this curiosity there such curiosity about what we can do with technology and i think thats possibly the biggest opportunity that it ha given a lot of u at the moment yeah the other thing that i went to speak to some policy people of my old job and they said come and speak to u do you know about ai im sorry i cant come and speak to about ai but ill also speak to about some other thing and they asked the question of how do you think what impact should you think this will have on the way that we work and for me it wa an opportunity to say actually i think that we should be sat side by side building this technology i mean we should be doing that anyway with,Digital & AI transformation in the Public Sector
10,10_18,it wa an opportunity to say actually i think that we should be sat side by side building this technology i mean we should be doing that anyway with technology but particularly with genie ai where you are testing and retesting and fine tuning the technology i think it brings operational colleague policy colleague digital colleague closer together and i think that can really be a good thing definitely and do you think it made are you talking about sort of legacy technology and sort of government government department have been around for a long time do you think it enabled sort of the younger generation to look at your role to look at what youre doing and actually see it a quite a more exciting than perhaps they used to and youre sort of seeing that sort of a sort of interest in getting these new digital skill and joining your workforce thats an interesting question i dont know you know i think that what do i think i think that when people look at government they still have an image of,Digital & AI transformation in the Public Sector
10,10_19,an interesting question i dont know you know i think that what do i think i think that when people look at government they still have an image of what thats like in or civil service and they still have an image of what thats like and so i think it hard for people to kind of connect to that imagine and see themselves in those role so i think where the thing that is more likely to influence people is where we are talking to people and they can see where normal human being and actually and were grappling with some quite interesting problem that for me that for me is more powerful than any kind of individual technology and getting people excited about these type of role definitely or not youre a perfect face for it i mean you talk so eloquently and yeah it quite inspiring to hear about your vision so thank you so much gina for joining u on the podcast again because obviously we have spoken to in the past and hopefully speak to you again soon thank you thank you for listening to the,Digital & AI transformation in the Public Sector

11,11_0,hello and welcome to the servicenow executive circle maximising the minute on ai miniseries in each episode of this new miniseries in ai we take a topic or theme from our discussion from our brilliant executive circle guest and were talking to adam spearing the head of ai innovation at servicenow who can deepdifurder into that topic welcome adam thank you for having me again so a topic that keep coming up and is actually being talked about a a trend for next year but i know that servicenow is really talking about it and i know that were already doing it is a genetic ai now what is it so the way i think about a genetic ai is imagine having lot of bot right everybodys most people are familiar with a bot and a bot doe something if you can get bot talking to each other then you can get them to make some decision so let say youve got a bot that can look at ticket for it and youve got a bot that can look at provisioning of technology if you get those two bot talking to each other they can,Maximising the Minutes on AI: Agentic AI and the Next Wave of Business Transformation
11,11_1,can look at ticket for it and youve got a bot that can look at provisioning of technology if you get those two bot talking to each other they can say well ive got a problem here oh and the other one can say well ive got a problem here is my problem caused by your problem oh well then let see if we can solve our problem together and thats with the concept in very crude term of what a genetic ai is about so this is where youre going to start to see the opportunity for different technology to interact with each other so let say youve got a microsoft microsoft copilot and now assist interaction together is actually a genetic technology it two ai technology working off of each other it now assist saying to copilot hey this user had a failure of their it the other week and by the way the license theyve got for that software theyre not using and copilot going to the user and going hey did you know that youve got some software youre not using and your laptop keep failing you do a new one so,Maximising the Minutes on AI: Agentic AI and the Next Wave of Business Transformation
11,11_2,copilot going to the user and going hey did you know that youve got some software youre not using and your laptop keep failing you do a new one so thats an example of a genetic technology very simply and so with that move business away from being reactive to being quite predictive like oh ive spotted a few trend here like those license i can actually preempt the next 100 people who are going to come to me and say my license run out because actually i already know now from that example so it kind of like you can imagine each bot like a domino effect each bot will knock onto the next one the next one yeah exactly exactly and actually you leave me onto one of the thing that im most excited about a well is this thing called knowledge graph so using the bot and using this genetic technology we can augment system to work off of each other right now were a workflow engine we happen to show up a an itsm tool an hr tool a help desk tool a wrist tool etc etc but we are fundamentally a workflow,Maximising the Minutes on AI: Agentic AI and the Next Wave of Business Transformation
11,11_3,now were a workflow engine we happen to show up a an itsm tool an hr tool a help desk tool a wrist tool etc etc but we are fundamentally a workflow platform driven by ai and there lot of uniqueness in our what we do but when you start thinking about what we actually know we know so much about where you are what youre working on what your laptop say what software youre using and so what that mean is that when you get to that mass personalization using something like the knowledge graph we can actually sit down and say hey youve just called in because i dont know i had banked this up today wa oh 70 of our call to the help desk are password and recess im like really still yes they are okay well this technology can say to you well i know youve got a mac so im not going to show you the window version of that password reset ill show you the version thats just for you oh and by the way i know you havent done your password reset this isnt the third time you failed to do it im going to,Maximising the Minutes on AI: Agentic AI and the Next Wave of Business Transformation
11,11_4,the version thats just for you oh and by the way i know you havent done your password reset this isnt the third time you failed to do it im going to recommend the call for you so thats where you use thing like the knowledge graph to personalize the experience for the consumer for the employee but then a a business you can say well hang on a minute why have i got 5000 license of this and only three of them being used why am i paying for that why am i how many people are actually working on this project and that that with the knowledge graph then suddenly becomes a really insightful use then you can start to getting to the unknown right the unconscious incompetence area where the technology can go i keep seeing this issue come up i keep seeing this issue come up every time i see this issue you tell me to do that do you want me a the ai technology to change your policy oh yes please click ive changed the policy the incident have come down because everybodys happier because now the policy,Maximising the Minutes on AI: Agentic AI and the Next Wave of Business Transformation
11,11_5,to change your policy oh yes please click ive changed the policy the incident have come down because everybodys happier because now the policy match reality and thats an evolution i think that is going to be very exciting in 2025 it amazing how many time even human being are like oh if so and so had spoken to so and so we wouldnt be in this predicament precisely and so do you see obviously the example youve just given were very much password reset and thing like that but i mean im thinking of these thing that always come up in our local area there a lot of road work around where we are because theyve just dug up the road for one water pipe and then the following week theyre digging up the road for electricity imagine if they spoke to each other do you see those kind of application like if an organisation sort of had that you know one bot thats looking after the water pipe maintenance infrastructure and the other bot thats looking after the electricity infrastructure oh well just dig,Maximising the Minutes on AI: Agentic AI and the Next Wave of Business Transformation
11,11_6,thats looking after the water pipe maintenance infrastructure and the other bot thats looking after the electricity infrastructure oh well just dig it up once wouldnt that be cool yeah so thats a great example of it on a business to business environment yes because when youre running a business and you think about all the thing you do you repeat too many thing time and time again oh were running an enablement session for team abc and next week were running an enablement session for team abc well why dont we do one enablement session for team abc and actually do it once and do it properly so there are lot of business to business example of where the technology can help with the bot to bot conversation the agentic conversation to simplify and make the process run smoother okay i mean ive seen example of well ive seen example of organization whose expense management process where they have different technology take people three or four hour to log an expense claim even today right now,Maximising the Minutes on AI: Agentic AI and the Next Wave of Business Transformation
11,11_7,whose expense management process where they have different technology take people three or four hour to log an expense claim even today right now with agentic technology you can remove all of the unnecessary out of that and simplify and streamline just a one example right and there load of area if youre running a business you know where the pocket are probably not when youre sitting in the csuite but i guarantee you the people who are doing the doing know where those issue are and by freeing them up and allowing the agentic technology to then help them iterate you can really make some fundamental change and were all looking for productivity gain weve been looking for those ever since you know cain wrote that paper and then many year ago nearly over 100 year ago weve been elusive productivity gain and i think finally were able to unlock a lot of those for everybody well thats fascinating and finally youve actually managed to explain it in a way that i get hopefully i listen is going to,Maximising the Minutes on AI: Agentic AI and the Next Wave of Business Transformation
11,11_8,lot of those for everybody well thats fascinating and finally youve actually managed to explain it in a way that i get hopefully i listen is going to understand i think thats fascinating and it not that complicated honestly we put this gloss over the fund of this technology sometimes just to create this allure that were unique and special technology is actually quite straightforward if you just take the time to learn it so obviously youre speaking to a number of organisation around europe around the globe other than agentic ai being big next year are there any sort of other common similarity and trend and thing that you see coming up yeah no i think one of the fascinating thing wa in 2023 2023 2024 end of 2023 beginning of 2024 we saw a lot of the hype a lot of oh we all need ai we all need ai woo and then we got into this cycle of taking the technology and trying to find the problem and that created a lot of frustration and a lot of er why is it not delivering and i think were coming,Maximising the Minutes on AI: Agentic AI and the Next Wave of Business Transformation
11,11_9,the technology and trying to find the problem and that created a lot of frustration and a lot of er why is it not delivering and i think were coming to that point where organisation are going to hang on a minute let use this let deploy this technology in the way weve always done it let look for the use case look for the roi build the fundamental and let build this a a business case and we saw during that period a well this kind of er outburst of were going to build our own language model right and everybodys suddenly going actually thats probably not such a good idea in my 30 year of technology build ha never actually been the most cost effective way to do it versus the commercial technology that are available for lot of reason and so what a we go into 2025 i am very excited about agentics im very excited about this knowledge graph concept and the ability for u to personalise experience across the organisation for everybody but also im very bored by the fact that a lot of the,Maximising the Minutes on AI: Agentic AI and the Next Wave of Business Transformation
11,11_10,concept and the ability for u to personalise experience across the organisation for everybody but also im very bored by the fact that a lot of the organisation have got their head straight on their strategy theyre thinking about their governance theyre thinking about the suite of technology theyre going to use theyve realised it not just one were very fortunate that in many most of those instance are unique offering put u a a core technology for doing that and i think theyre now starting to understand how to capitalise on this so we will achieve more in the long term than we could possibly believe even though were slightly frustrated in the short term with this technology and do you see any particular challenge that are still arising obviously have had to overcome the challenge of just the general excitement of ai what do i do with it any other challenge that you see sort of coming yeah the one that slightly keep me awake at night is the devolved responsibility where at the very,Maximising the Minutes on AI: Agentic AI and the Next Wave of Business Transformation
11,11_11,it any other challenge that you see sort of coming yeah the one that slightly keep me awake at night is the devolved responsibility where at the very beginning it wa the csuite garing yes yes yes yes let go let go and now theyre kind of oh well im done with that yet and theyve got to stick with this because this isnt a quick flick of switch and it done and this isnt a oh it a techie project to give it to the it team this ha to remain if you want to capitalise on the opportunity this ha to remain a a board level agenda item because it not just about what are we using the technology to do it about how were enabling our people how were controlling our data and our governance to make sure we keep the csuite out of jail that it not leaking off somewhere we dont want it to go accidentally so there a whole plethora of thing we need to do and then the opportunity for the csuite is well how can i rebuild my business if youre a ceo if you sat down with a clean piece of paper and said well how,Maximising the Minutes on AI: Agentic AI and the Next Wave of Business Transformation

11,11_13,epiphany they have of what hang on so rather than u talking to you every six or nine month and seeing what youre doing we need to talk with you every three month we need to look at what youre releasing because the product is coming out so fast and we need to say within 90 day what are we deploying in the next 90 day with one eye on what youre delivering in the next the following 90 day or with roi so that were in this constant virtuous cycle of being agile in how we adopt the technology a opposed to right well this year i think were going to use a b and c right it a 90day cycle youve got to be in to really capitalise and move a quick a the technology is i think a key point you just said is how we use a technology and you mentioned in a previous episode about digital skill thats going to be a big thing a well next year and it not just about hiring a many prompt engineer a you can possibly find this is about training people to be able to augment their role by having that understanding,Maximising the Minutes on AI: Agentic AI and the Next Wave of Business Transformation
11,11_14,hiring a many prompt engineer a you can possibly find this is about training people to be able to augment their role by having that understanding that critical thinking and analysis of what ai is serving them not necessarily needing the programming skill and i think thats something were going to see massively next year is that kind of understanding of what are the digital skill that my employee need and how can i provide that to them yeah and we saw this so many year ago there wa and it still ongoing this concept of a citizen developer right and it wa this battle between it and business where it saying citizen developer bad business saying citizen developer good because business want flexibility it want control of the data and i think in most organisation weve got to a happy balance between that if you get it right you can protect the data and give the citizen the freedom and flexibility and actually enhance the developer community for it without formal trained developer now exactly,Maximising the Minutes on AI: Agentic AI and the Next Wave of Business Transformation
11,11_15,and give the citizen the freedom and flexibility and actually enhance the developer community for it without formal trained developer now exactly the same a true with ai in my view in that we want our employee to be conversant to be comfortable to be competent in using the technology but what we dont want them to do is go off and do dumb thing and thats where i think a an organisation you have to say well what level of knowledge do i want to skill people up to yes im going to have llm engineer and im going to have machine learning engineer and phd scientist in my it group brilliant you need them but equally ive got an army of thousand of people who if i teach them to use the technology how the right way i can unleash huge amount of potential huge amount of potential but also using those people to help educate so looking at it from a bottom up a well it all well and good a being yes it a sea level a sea suite level strategy but the daytoday user of it they can source and find those,Maximising the Minutes on AI: Agentic AI and the Next Wave of Business Transformation

12,12_0,gerard really great to have you today im excited about this subject because were going to get a little bit deep and nerdy what is it my friend great question thanks for having me chad yes semantic search is a way of getting information to your end user we often hear in the field where are you using semantic search are you using semantic search the answer is we are using it were using it in now assist it a way to allow for fuzzier matching and getting information to end user this might be a great parlay to the second question how doe it work and maybe why doe it matter here it is how it work this is where we get nerdy this is where we start talking number so basically the way that it work is we have something called a semantic encoder these semantic encoders basically take word in this case in english and translate them into number people often call the thing that store semantic vector database because youre basically building out a vector for your content or your search query were,AI Search - ServiceNow {GenAI Inside Track} Now Assist for IT
12,12_1,often call the thing that store semantic vector database because youre basically building out a vector for your content or your search query were basically doing matching on the question thats being asked and the content that we have are trying to figure out how similar they are why matter is because we have a lot of customer that ask question that are very similar in meaning to specific type of information but do not exactly match from a keyword perspective so when you think of can i get access to outlook or can i request access to outlook you need to understand that get and request are very similar in meaning and provide that a a response there are some gap in that but we can talk about that a little bit later all right all right so with that in your experience because youve been doing this a lot with customer in the field what my success look like for our customer yeah in this case this idea of having a semantically similar content success look like our end customer not needing to,AI Search - ServiceNow {GenAI Inside Track} Now Assist for IT
12,12_2,look like for our customer yeah in this case this idea of having a semantically similar content success look like our end customer not needing to perform a lot of heavy lift on editing their knowledge base article or their catalog item and really having a more natural experience with the content without needing to do a lot of tuning and tweaking so what weve seen in the field is that when weve offered these semantic capability a part of now assist there is an uplift of roughly 5 on our recall scale which doesnt sound like a lot i know but it actually is when you consider you know the thousand upon thousand of request that customer get per day at 5 to your point 5 doesnt sound like a lot but this end up increasing exponentially so i got a final question by the way you mentioned gap so what is on the roadmap for this yeah the biggest issue you can say with semantic technology is that were using an encoder like i mentioned earlier there are some word that the encoder just doesnt know so,AI Search - ServiceNow {GenAI Inside Track} Now Assist for IT
12,12_3,you can say with semantic technology is that were using an encoder like i mentioned earlier there are some word that the encoder just doesnt know so it just make up a number for that term so you may have and it doe the same thing for acronym too so you may have business specific term or acronym are using and were basically going to match or have strange match on those so in the roadmap were combining our sort of legacy keyword approach which includes a lot of the synonym and business specific term or even company specific term that can be configured by customer and combining that with semantic technology so what end user will end up getting is the best of both world and a unified sort of representation of what that look like that is awesome we only have four minute and four question i know you want to get a little bit deeper we have an opportunity if there any question concern want to get a little bit deeper please reach out to gerard myself in community you will see the url at the,AI Search - ServiceNow {GenAI Inside Track} Now Assist for IT

13,13_2,access to information access to complicated information much easier for any persona right i think with the rise of ai and llm what the most powerful thing about them is that you dont really need to be taking a class or taking a course or being in that data storage system to be able to get this information and understand it the ai agent with the right access and with the right power can get that for you and then also summarize it in a way that make the most sense because it can understand how to explain it to different type of persona so i think thats to me one of the most powerful but also pragmatic way to use ai yeah thats interesting of course it make if you look at our customer landscape it make a lot of sense because a lot of our customer come from this operation or service desk environment right so they have different l1 l2 l3 type of responsibility and depending on their level they will be dealing with information a you said in a very different way or different or different,Creating an agentic AI framework for observability
13,13_3,of responsibility and depending on their level they will be dealing with information a you said in a very different way or different or different complexity of information is getting to them so ai agent can help them decide for them or simplify them for you for them okay thats great so let get into a little bit of the world that we live in and that is it operation and tell u a little bit about how do these agent ai or ai agent will help specifically enhance this it operation role yeah of course so the ai agent that im building within itam are ai agent that collaborate autonomously with third party ai agent from best of breed observability platform and so the problem that were trying to solve is that when an it operator is trying to triage and investigate an alert they really need to understand very quickly what is the impact and severity of this alert and which team and subject matter expert can they pull in to start the investigation and the complexity is that the critical,Creating an agentic AI framework for observability
13,13_4,severity of this alert and which team and subject matter expert can they pull in to start the investigation and the complexity is that the critical information to answer these two question resides in information silo it resides within service now but it also most elusively it resides in third party observability tool and to make the problem worse these it operator they dont often have access to these tool and when they do the learning curve for these tool is very high right theyre not built for it operator with more limited technical knowledge and so with ai agent you can sort of like break the barrier of access first of all because these ai agent can automatically contact a lot of these best of breed tool and they can also simplify the information and present it in a way thats very operatorfriendly and so with access to the information understanding and context of the information they can very quickly understand impact and severity a well a get enough like nugget of knowledge to,Creating an agentic AI framework for observability
13,13_5,understanding and context of the information they can very quickly understand impact and severity a well a get enough like nugget of knowledge to start the investigation with the subject matter expert yeah so i mean this is great because a lot of time when we talking to customer they just dont have one two or three tool theyve had sometimes half a dozen or even sometimes it doesnt tool right and it open more environment when youre monitoring your apps your microservices you probably have open source tool so it just help them right because it becomes almost a manager of manager kind of approach for a lot of work thats what itom doe today we embrace like an open system open ecosystem of observability and monitoring vendor we already connect with them via event management they can now set they can send event and alert into itom and from there thats sort of the entry point for the it operator and our agentic approach is exactly the same right in the world of ai agent we want to be the,Creating an agentic AI framework for observability
13,13_6,there thats sort of the entry point for the it operator and our agentic approach is exactly the same right in the world of ai agent we want to be the manager of the manager of ai agent we want to be the agent of agent and we want to help the it operator connect all of these vendor and to be able to facilitate a collaboration amongst ai agent and it doesnt really matter how the other agent the other third party agent are built right i mean they could be using their own llm they could be using their own data structure what matter is the data that come to service now is that the right yeah exactly and i think also to add on to that the information that they provide is very harmonious with the information that we already have so we can take the information that they have based off of like triceps log and metric and combine that harmoniously with the information that we have within the cmdb and sort of like the workflow and post mortems and like previous incident and alert and we can marry,Creating an agentic AI framework for observability
13,13_7,the information that we have within the cmdb and sort of like the workflow and post mortems and like previous incident and alert and we can marry that together and give the operator sort of like the best suggestion on what the next step should be yeah there also this brings up a good topic you mentioned cmdb so cmdb is a great way for becoming a providing a system of record for a lot of enterprise today but even if you dont have a great cmdb today or youre still in the process of building a quality cmdb this approach can still work right i mean they dont have to be bound down to say that you know i need to get my cmdb like 70 to ready state exactly it pretty much decoupled yeah and i think i mentioned this very briefly in the beginning that whole data strategy the service now ha around work for data fabric and the rapridb which is kind of pretty advanced way of processing your data that also help because you know we are not bound to a specific data structure or a specific format it,Creating an agentic AI framework for observability
13,13_8,of pretty advanced way of processing your data that also help because you know we are not bound to a specific data structure or a specific format it could be able to format it could be done in a any way that we can ingest that information into service now so then we also call it a knowledge graph which is kind of another way of thinking about how the relationship are built so thats great let go a little bit into do you want to give u specific scenario you know you are working right now in the middle of this huge development and we will see that our development being released in the coming month but if you take a specific use case do you want to walk down a specific use case with what youre building with some of the other agent yeah and so yeah and i think it always help to anchor around a very concrete use case and so the one that you know we see a lot when we work with a lot of ecommerce company enterprise company is that for example the alert that come into itom will first be say on,Creating an agentic AI framework for observability
13,13_9,we see a lot when we work with a lot of ecommerce company enterprise company is that for example the alert that come into itom will first be say on a application service called the payment service and so it the operator job to sort of understand when they see this alert for the payment service say it like the sla for availability is breached right normally it should be 95 it now 94 and so the operator really in a world without ai agent they need to figure out whats the impact and severity of the alert and who to pull in to start the investigation and so with ai agent now the operator can open now assist and automatically we can detect that okay this alert is from vendor xyz but given we have an integration with them our ai agent will just autonomously reach out to their ai agent to say hey can you tell u more about the alert what other entity are you seeing being impacted do you have supporting metric to sort of like support that claim do you see any thing that might have caused that,Creating an agentic AI framework for observability
13,13_10,are you seeing being impacted do you have supporting metric to sort of like support that claim do you see any thing that might have caused that change recent deploys configuration change and this is all information that we can get in real time to help this operator figure out so can i snooze or do i really need to go deeper into this investigation for the payment service yeah i think thats a great use case because that come up a lot right in our customer who are doing real time transaction and they need to make sure that there no anomaly or they can stay ahead of a little bit of anomaly thats coming up it a lot of rich data thats out there but also talk a little bit about this go back to more of an ai ops kind of workflow to write once we get all this rich data were able to freeogit were able to present it to a customer in a more this could be an element of autonomous aspect versus assisted aspect can you talk a little bit about where doe autonomous or of ai agent could come in versus,Creating an agentic AI framework for observability
13,13_11,be an element of autonomous aspect versus assisted aspect can you talk a little bit about where doe autonomous or of ai agent could come in versus assisted yeah i think we want to give that control to the customer themselves so you can see this in sort of like different layer of autonomy the first layer maybe the most conservative is that the ai agent is just presenting a recommendation so it not really acting on it but it giving the operator enough information to say hey this is what this is my guidance kind of take it or leave it but a we get more complex and integrated with action that either agent can take on behalf of the user the user can also in their configuration set it to something less conservative so not only is the ai agent telling them what is the rationale for next step it also implementing those next step and you can see the most liberal would be it acting on your behalf and it just giving you a conclusion of what it did in the last sort of day or two and so with the,Creating an agentic AI framework for observability
13,13_12,the most liberal would be it acting on your behalf and it just giving you a conclusion of what it did in the last sort of day or two and so with the first release we definitely want to tread carefully we know ai agent are new people are cautious there fear of hallucination we really just want to summarize and give them the rationale for what is the conclusion that ha been made and then a we launch more more and more agent we feel a lot more comfortable in age two or 2026 we can sort of ladder up those capability awesome yeah that make sense all right so a we get towards the end of this podcast how are customer can keep up to date and even if they want to get involved in this new development what can they do yeah i would say that we are you know we have blog we have update from the sort of normal service now channel a were rolling out more and more ai agent across all of the use not just ai ops and item and definitely if you are interested in being a design partner we would love to,Creating an agentic AI framework for observability
13,13_13,more and more ai agent across all of the use not just ai ops and item and definitely if you are interested in being a design partner we would love to work with you to sort of figure out what is your use case and how we can build ai agent to solve your problem reduce mttr in your behalf awesome this wa just a kind of very snippet small snippet of what were working on and were going to bring you more of these kind of episode that you can get up to speed on also you can go to servicenowcom our main page is loaded with not a lot of new use case that we are working on youll get you up to speed and danika thank you for being here today and were going to get you back here soon when you have some agent out there working for our customer but yeah thanks a lot for being here thanks for everyone for listening in until the next episode bye for now thank you,Creating an agentic AI framework for observability
14,14_0,hello im kat finch and welcome to the latest episode of the service now uk knight executive circle podcast series within our podcast we speak to some of the industry most exciting innovator thought leader and senior executive all with the aim of giving you our listener the inspiration insight and market intelligence you need to help drive your organisation forward this week were speaking to gina gill the chief strategy officer for the cabinet officer central digital and data office welcome gina thank you very much im delighted to be here now in this role that youve been in for a few month you are focusing on the new government digital strategy and delivering of transformation i wa really keen and interested in what you were saying about building the strategy the building the foundation sorry for this digital future for government in your view whats critical to the foundation that youre building so i think that relates to the reason that i moved to the centre in the first place so there,Digital & AI transformation in the Public Sector
14,14_1,whats critical to the foundation that youre building so i think that relates to the reason that i moved to the centre in the first place so there were two reason that i moved the first wa i couldnt see where we were going a government digital and data so i couldnt see the vision that brings u all together were over 20000 people working across many different government department and then if you add health and local authority into that then that number get much much bigger and i couldnt get a sense of what were collectively trying to do so i felt like we were building some great digital service and isolation but actually not necessarily solving that endtoend user experience across different department across different service across different agency so that wa reason number one having that clarity of where were going and then number two wa thing that we have called system reform i hate the name but it thing that slow down or prevent digital delivery within department so if you speak to,Digital & AI transformation in the Public Sector
14,14_2,thing that we have called system reform i hate the name but it thing that slow down or prevent digital delivery within department so if you speak to a hundred colleague the list the kind of same thing that are frustrating and those are thing that i think the centre is best placed to resolve and ha to resolve and it thing like money and incentive so how we fund digital work which isnt really aligned to digital delivery and it doesnt help u to deliver in our way it is much more aligned to kind of big infrastructure not technology infrastructure but big infrastructure project and program and big waterfall program so thats an issue for people incentive i think is the other thing so i dont think we incentivise department to work together so how do we how might we resolve that so if youre having some interest in conversation with treasury about that and thinking about thing we might be able to do in that space and related to that is you know we talk about efficiency a lot but again we dont,Digital & AI transformation in the Public Sector
14,14_3,that and thinking about thing we might be able to do in that space and related to that is you know we talk about efficiency a lot but again we dont we talk about efficiency within kind of a department or an agency budget not across the system and lot of and i think lot of the efficiency that we need to create is across the system so you know think about justice the cost of recidivism is 18 billion pound a year that doesnt sit in an individual department budget right thats the cost to uk plc how do you get after that how do you create the incentive to get after that so thats money and incentive the second area from the u capability and i dont mean capability within digital and data colleague i think you know weve been weve made weve made quite a lot of really good inroad into that but more broadly i think there still a lack of understanding of what digital mean across the civil service and across senior leader in the civil service i think we still see it a a back office function we,Digital & AI transformation in the Public Sector
14,14_4,of what digital mean across the civil service and across senior leader in the civil service i think we still see it a a back office function we still see it a a cost space and we dont really see it a frontline delivery and a lot of it is now frontline delivery and so there something about how do we change how do we help to help people to like better understand digital and how it can enable a different way of delivering service and then last but not least is is how we buy thing and work with industry were still very and weve got lot of different framework we did gclide but we still predominantly work with the same really big supplier we dont we havent done a well a we would have wanted to i dont think in term of working with smaller with like smes with smaller supplier with people who might have new and innovative technology that might help to build better experience and i think there a real opportunity in that space a well and a real opportunity to think about how do we go from,Digital & AI transformation in the Public Sector
14,14_5,help to build better experience and i think there a real opportunity in that space a well and a real opportunity to think about how do we go from innovate like how do we go from kind of testing thing to then actually kind of full on delivery without running you know many many procurement process lengthy procurement process along the way definitely so it sound like part of your strategy when the initial stage is going to be a bit of an internal change management piece like so that kind of cultural mindset shift to thinking about how digital can align a lot of these different government department i think that share service the interoperability between all the piece really need to come together to overcome some of the legacy technology and the silo that exist is that going to be part of your strategy that youre trying to do so it would definitely be part of the strategy and i mean what were talking about is cultural change right and cultural change across an organisation a system that,Digital & AI transformation in the Public Sector
14,14_6,be part of the strategy and i mean what were talking about is cultural change right and cultural change across an organisation a system that ha been in place for a very long time so thats not fast and it not easy but i think we have to say a really clear picture of where were going we have to say i kind of what the next kind of three to five year will hold and then we have to talk about those kind of foundational piece and what were going to do to address those over that period a well so with the new government encouraging the notion of doing more with less and using technology to improve efficiency there is a real need to not just build that longer term digital strategy that is robust but remain agile and respond to the political the economical and technological change that are inevitable and that are happening a we speak yep look at it hard it hard and it hard in a system where we know that every five or so year well have a potentially a new government in a different direction so i,Digital & AI transformation in the Public Sector
14,14_7,hard it hard and it hard in a system where we know that every five or so year well have a potentially a new government in a different direction so i think we need to separate where were going long term and set out a clear long term vision and that ha to be something that is hard to argue with and so i think it ha to be grounded in service and public service and i think it ha to be grounded in the user experience that we wanted to create for member of the public and for business and so that could be thing like that could be thing like we dont want people to have to share their data same data with u all for an over again it could be thing like we want interaction to be simpler we want interaction to be seamless we dont want people to need to understand which department theyre interacting with or which service or form they need so i think you can set up that picture of if this is what we want it to look and feel like in the future and then work with each government to look at how you,Digital & AI transformation in the Public Sector
14,14_8,you can set up that picture of if this is what we want it to look and feel like in the future and then work with each government to look at how you prioritize which service you focus on during that particular period so for this government for example it might be planning so aligned to the mission for growth so i think it yes set out the long term thats hard to argue with the kind of transcends and political party and election and then use kind of each new term to focus on the priority of the government at the time it a really difficult balance isnt there between the people that youre working with and how to make that shift and change in government to really what citizen expect theyve got apps theyre all using tiktok they are digital first digital native and theyve got lot of idea and they dont want to sit on a phone anymore they dont want to talk to a virtual agent anymore sorry a call center agent anymore so in your view what technology do you think is needed to try and get that,Digital & AI transformation in the Public Sector
14,14_9,want to talk to a virtual agent anymore sorry a call center agent anymore so in your view what technology do you think is needed to try and get that balance with a milestone so youre going to sort of build it so im actually trying not to think about technology because i think that i think technology change so quickly that were in danger of saying were in danger of setting out a strategy that say yeah were going to use this particular technology to reach this goal i think we really need to focus on outcome and i worry that in the past we kind of go through phase of different buzzword and when i first landed in government it wa rpa so robotic process automation i wa a reddit a strategy i wa at meeting a few month ago where they were talking about robot and i genuinely thought they meant physical robot until i realized they meant they didnt mean physical robot at all we were talking about robotic automation a you know over the past euro say ai is the word on everyones lip and i think,Digital & AI transformation in the Public Sector
14,14_10,mean physical robot at all we were talking about robotic automation a you know over the past euro say ai is the word on everyones lip and i think that if we get too caught up in the technology we end up implementing technology for technology sake potentially putting lipstick on a peg and not actually solving the problem that we set out to solve when jenny i burst onto the scene i wa at the moj at the time and i would get people emailing me from that i had never met before in your organization ive got a great idea here i think we should do this in many eye perspective we can do ai prison visit i dont even understand what that mean so i think we have to really make sure that people get excited about the problem that theyre solving and not about the technology i completely agree i had a fantastic conversation with sally ann hick shes the global vp of automation experience and shes a huge advocate focusing on the business outcome first the challenge that youre trying and naturally ai,Digital & AI transformation in the Public Sector
14,14_11,global vp of automation experience and shes a huge advocate focusing on the business outcome first the challenge that youre trying and naturally ai might not always be the natural answer to the question there is a journey there an evolution of what youre trying to achieve based on what those challenge are and speaking of challenge and the foundation youre trying to put in place do you see reskilling and upskilling and the general digital skill piece ha a challenge or a bit of an opportunity with your team and your department i think it an opportunity and i think look the excitement so the one thing that ai ha done is it opened the door to many conversation that we werent having before which is a good thing and i think that that help u then to have conversation about skill and you know when we last spoke i talked about the fact that that doesnt mean that we need to turn everyone into a techie for a format i think it much more about having the skill to be able to operate in a digital,Digital & AI transformation in the Public Sector
14,14_12,doesnt mean that we need to turn everyone into a techie for a format i think it much more about having the skill to be able to operate in a digital age which really is an age of change constant change and so it about being able to work with people with different skill set it about being able to really focus on what is the problem that were trying to solve and what is the experience of the user thats using the service it much more about the ability to think naturally to solve problem and the desire to understand how other people are solving problem i think and kind of trying to bring some of that back into government is that clear there a lot more just to skill it more about the digital literacy how do you interpret the data how do you i mean ive seen job role advertised for ai prompter so people are actually working out what do i need to prompt ai to get the information out and actually thats a skill in itself and i think we have to not ignore the human intelligence that go with the,Digital & AI transformation in the Public Sector
14,14_13,prompt ai to get the information out and actually thats a skill in itself and i think we have to not ignore the human intelligence that go with the artificial intelligence and there is a skill to that there a skill to being the human in the loop to make sure that youre using the technology in the right way absolutely and there an interesting debate about actually do we end up with human skill that are actrifying because were replacing them with technology so people lose the ability to bring that human lens and how to keep the right balance in that and i think i mean cddo ha been working on a framework for where ai shouldnt be used or how to think about where to use ai particularly generative ai and we had the same kind of linked at the ministry of justice and it wa in some case it wa specific to different business area so for example in court it an absolute red line in term of technology making judgment thats just not a line were willing to cross and therefore it i guess relatively,Digital & AI transformation in the Public Sector
14,14_14,court it an absolute red line in term of technology making judgment thats just not a line were willing to cross and therefore it i guess relatively easy in that space to say this is where the line is i think it actually harder in other space to say this is where the line is but those are the conversation we need to be having yeah i think it introduced touched there on a little bit of almost like a bit of a digital divide and not losing the sort of the human skill that we have if we rely solely on technology that actually you could see you know they talk about thing like ai and technology being able to bring that digital divide together but there also an opportunity to challenge there with a bit of a fear that it could expand that divide because you know like we all use the calculator and im terrible at mentor we dont want to lose the ability that we have just because we then become solely reliant on technology absolutely absolutely i think thats a real progress definitely i think,Digital & AI transformation in the Public Sector
14,14_15,ability that we have just because we then become solely reliant on technology absolutely absolutely i think thats a real progress definitely i think another area thats interesting with the sort of the human and the artificial intelligence is the sort of the bias around ai i dont know if youve seen the latest tv advert with dove and we havent actually it really powerful because they sort of type in to the sort of chat but you know give me a photo of a beautiful woman and so of course it generates what it think is a beautiful woman and then you know you can put in the information give me an image of what is a dove beautiful woman and thats when you get back the image and their different size different colour and it it it suddenly becomes more representative and i think there is there is a fear there on what that bias is you know if we dont put it in the right date and especially for you i think with that customer first mentality and looking at your citizen experience you have to get,Digital & AI transformation in the Public Sector
14,14_16,put it in the right date and especially for you i think with that customer first mentality and looking at your citizen experience you have to get that data right you dont want to put anything bias into your system because youre then going to be getting the right user experience out absolutely agree but i also think that there is there is so much data that sits across government that is it subjective like because so again going back to the moj like case note and i say just damage in health at doctor case note so that there lot of that type of information in data that sits in government and there and you need to that information and that information will likely have some level of bias in it because you know a human we all have a level of bias so it about how do you how do you make sure that youre not amplifying that bias and i think i think thats hard and i think we only find that by by experimenting safely but experimenting to see what level of kind of accuracy we get when we test ai,Digital & AI transformation in the Public Sector
14,14_17,thats hard and i think we only find that by by experimenting safely but experimenting to see what level of kind of accuracy we get when we test ai in different scenario and then we have to make decision on whether that level of accuracy is good enough and whether it good enough for public service particularly definitely i think thats where ai ha a very positive force is it creating this curiosity there such curiosity about what we can do with technology and i think thats possibly the biggest opportunity that that it ha given a lot of a lot of u at the moment yeah the other thing that i um i went to speak to some policy people of my old job and they said come and come and speak to u do you know about ai im sorry i cant come and speak to about ai but ill speak to that a well i think and and they asked the question of how do you how do you think um but what impact should you think this will have on on the way that we work and for me it wa an opportunity to say actually i think that you,Digital & AI transformation in the Public Sector
14,14_18,think um but what impact should you think this will have on on the way that we work and for me it wa an opportunity to say actually i think that you know we should be sat side by side and building this technology i mean we should be doing that anyway with with technology but particularly with with jenny ai where you are testing and retesting and kind of finetuning the technology i think it brings operational colleague policy colleague digital colleague closely together and i think that that can really be a good thing definitely and do you think it made are you talking about sort of legacy technology and sort of government technology government department have been around for a long time do you think it enabled sort of the younger generation to look at your role to look at what youre doing and actually see it a quite more exciting than perhaps they used to and youre sort of seeing that sort of a sort of interest in getting these new digital skill and joining your workforce thats an,Digital & AI transformation in the Public Sector
14,14_19,perhaps they used to and youre sort of seeing that sort of a sort of interest in getting these new digital skill and joining your workforce thats an interesting question i dont know you know i i think that what do i think i think that when people look at government they still have an image of what thats like in or civil service and they still have an image of what thats like and so i think it hard for people to kind of connect to that and imagine and see themselves in those role and so i i think where um the thing that is more likely to influence people is where we are talking to people and they can see where normal human being and actually and and and were grappling with some quite interesting problem that that for me that for me is more powerful than any kind of individual technology and getting people excited about these type of role definitely well no and youre a perfect face for it i mean you talk so eloquently and yeah it quite inspiring to hear about your vision so thank you so,Digital & AI transformation in the Public Sector
14,14_20,well no and youre a perfect face for it i mean you talk so eloquently and yeah it quite inspiring to hear about your vision so thank you so much gene if joining u on the podcast again because obviously ive spoken to in the past and hopefully speak to you again soon thank you thank you for listening to the servicenow ukni executive circle podcast if youve enjoyed this or any of the other episode of this podcast series please do take a moment to rate or review u on your podcast platform of choice wed love your feedback finally im cat finch the host of the servicenow ukni executive circle podcast thank you again for listening and speak with you again soon,Digital & AI transformation in the Public Sector
15,15_0,welcome to today servicenow uk and i executive serve the podcast im delighted to be joined by sally and hick the global vice president of automation at experian hi thank you for having me so sally i think we have to start with what doe a global vice president of automation do and why is it so pertinent to a company like experian so thats a great question and i think when i joined the organization people thought i would be looking for pocket of automation you know for pocket of thing that we could automate on a task level basis but we really developed that role and that capability into something far wider reaching that cover really the end to end of everything experience doing were looking at how we accelerate value how we bring you know our value point with our customer earlier in the in the journey were looking at how we generate efficiency across our delivery organization and were looking at automation opportunity throughout those throughout those value point really so can we put it,Episode Eleven: Experian - Putting AI and automation to work 
15,15_1,across our delivery organization and were looking at automation opportunity throughout those throughout those value point really so can we put it in a good example obviously we will probably use experience to check our credit score how doe automation you know whats it been doing to support that experience from an end user perspective so there b2c which is where you know we know our credit score and then there the b2b business which is all about delivering great software to our customer so you know what doe that mean and who are our customer so the software we deliver essentially sits within three pillar weve got decisioning software weve got analytics software and weve got identity and fraud software our customer are lender so people who are lending money to u a consumer so traditionally that wa the bank you know the barclays and santanders but you know a thing move forward in the world that we all know actually the lender you know are you know in healthcare in automotive in buy now,Episode Eleven: Experian - Putting AI and automation to work

15,15_3,global business so our region in our organization deliver that software to their customer were about enabling them so we need to make sure that we can deliver our world class software a fast a possible that we enable those regional delivery team to be a efficient a possible so it how do we get the software out there how do we enable everything to do with the software in the most automated way thats possible so we talk about a vision for one click on boarding for our customer and we talk about those delivery organization being able to focus on the thing that matter most which is their customer experience and being able to focus on the thing where they can add value a human and not be you know focused on repeat task and thing that can be done for people so that they can you know value add a lot of those those thing you just talked about the value that it provides are often thing spoken about in regard to generative ai where doe automation finish and end or doe it not and where doe,Episode Eleven: Experian - Putting AI and automation to work 
15,15_4,the value that it provides are often thing spoken about in regard to generative ai where doe automation finish and end or doe it not and where doe generative ai so i wouldnt think of them a either beginning or ending i think of probably thing more in layer so and back to you know when i joined the organization and people probably thinking that i would come here and automate task so you know would you need to send those email that you sent today or could something do that for you you know would you need to create that report or someone could someone do that for you but actually what i do is look at the end to end so if i take the example of on boarding a new client the end to end is the journey from when a customer decides to buy our software from u to the day that theyre up and running on that software and that involves thing like building the solution designing it you know configuring it testing it giving the customer access to the solution you know different customer access to,Episode Eleven: Experian - Putting AI and automation to work 
15,15_5,the solution designing it you know configuring it testing it giving the customer access to the solution you know different customer access to different element of the solution based on their their persona and creating you know secure transport access so that they can share file with u and thing like that all of those thing and so there a process involved with that right well i take away from that is it not just you know like we use chat to you we put in some information that we want to turn something out youre weaving it in a part of that end and process a i said a a layer and i think what i really took from that wa really interesting is that youve got to have that what am i trying to do with it first what is that problem what is that outlook that im trying to achieve and then how doe it woven in to get to that right outcome exactly and i think a lot of people think of generous of idea and we can just plug in and it going to do something but if you dont know what you want to achieve,Episode Eleven: Experian - Putting AI and automation to work 
15,15_6,i think a lot of people think of generous of idea and we can just plug in and it going to do something but if you dont know what you want to achieve youre not really going to get what you want out of it so what do you recommend to other business and other leader in your position who are saying look where do i start so i think dont start thinking i need to do generative ai you need to know what your problem are you need to know the problem youre trying to solve and you need to have decided what your what your vision is what good look like yeah so you know and most business leader will know this right you know theyll have you know some fairly clear view about the problem that they face the challenge and what they want their delivery to look like what they want their organization their service offering you know whether it a product or service organization they will know where theyre trying to go they will have a vision and a strategy and you know they should know the thing that are wrong,Episode Eleven: Experian - Putting AI and automation to work 
15,15_7,organization they will know where theyre trying to go they will have a vision and a strategy and you know they should know the thing that are wrong in the organization at a macro level if not a micro level so the thing that arent happening and you know it that that they need to dig into further to find the thing that actually they want to automate to make more repeatable to have just happen automatically so that people within the organization can a i say focus on value i think you know every leader will know that within their organization actually there a lot of waste if theyre honest with themselves you know in any organization probably over 100 people there could be 20 to 30 waste and and by that i mean task that people are doing that are ultimately not adding value to the bottom line and you know that happens because nothing stay the same you know were all always changing and adapting but yet people job do not change and adapt a quickly a the environment around u and if they dont,Episode Eleven: Experian - Putting AI and automation to work 
15,15_8,same you know were all always changing and adapting but yet people job do not change and adapt a quickly a the environment around u and if they dont adapt then essentially what you could be doing is doing something that isnt required anymore and some people are smart and figure that out and stop doing it themselves but oftentimes most people at the grassroots have to be told dont do that anymore and so it our job a leader and visionary to figure out what the new thing look like what the new target operating model is and to stop all of the thing that we used to do that we dont need to do anymore and an automation and generative ai will be a value to u when we figure out that thing but weve kind of got to figure out that first yeah and then we automate the thing that we need to carry on doing and we use generative ai to help u create them more efficiently and i think a really particular word you used in that answer wa people and obviously that youre saying taking them on that journey,Episode Eleven: Experian - Putting AI and automation to work 
15,15_9,more efficiently and i think a really particular word you used in that answer wa people and obviously that youre saying taking them on that journey some people come to that realization how they can do thing differently others dont how do you go about in an organization that change that sort of change transformation i mean business have been on a digital transformation journey for a long time this is just another evolution but how do you bring them on that journey so i think openness is really important and allowing everyone on your organization to see and understand your vision your strategy and your view of what good look like and where youre going is really important i think that most people struggle with adapting to change is when they dont understand that but if you can take your time to tell and show people where youre going then actually every human ha the ability to understand that certain thing need to change so thats the most important thing and thats every layer of the,Episode Eleven: Experian - Putting AI and automation to work 
15,15_10,actually every human ha the ability to understand that certain thing need to change so thats the most important thing and thats every layer of the organization you know no strategy can be created in a boardroom and executed without you know that cascading all the way down through the organization it sound obvious right im you know probably preaching to the converted but everything we do ha to drive that culture of you know change and understanding of knowledge of the strategy of sharing it ha to be you know throughout what we do it an imprint of everything we do so whats the queen of automation if there wa one thing in your life even outside of work that you could automate what would it be but you know ive had a really painful experience recently with my with my pension so ive been doing probably what many people will will have gone through which is to transfer you know a company pension part with a previous organization into my into my new company it a terrible process you know i had,Episode Eleven: Experian - Putting AI and automation to work 
15,15_11,which is to transfer you know a company pension part with a previous organization into my into my new company it a terrible process you know i had to fill in some online form digital form to say i wanted to go through this process excellent i think this whole thing is going to be managed digitally no it doesnt work like that so they send me a pack of about 20 a4 page right and 12 of those page are form for me to fill in and return but im not told how i need to submit my form im not given an envelope to submit my form and im not told whether i need to get them back from my new provider and send them in one go or whether i need to send them separately i just just ludicrous it get worse than this because when i havent filled them in because im going through a process of figuring out what to fill in i get sent a second pack hey sally you wanted to to to transfer your pension you dont seem to have responded to the first pack we send you so here another pack i start sending the form back,Episode Eleven: Experian - Putting AI and automation to work

16,16_1,love i would almost consider service operation to be part of my servicenow superhero origin story so i originally worked in operation thats where my background is and i wa always a bit kind of jealous about the serviceguys because they seemed to be able to affect more change into an organization and i wa able to at the operation level and so i switched to do more servicerelated thing and i found out that actually the serviceguys were a bit kind of jealous of the operationsguys because they had all the data and the insight really we were operating independently and not delivering the value we should have done so i think service operation there a lot of name for it there a lot of part of it but that kind of combination of those two world is something that im passionate about because i think it really delivers value for customer and i really like that kerry is really about connecting the silo of process building itas itsm and it operation coming together i thought telco could be really a,Unlocking Service Operations with AI: Insights from Carey Blunt
16,16_2,like that kerry is really about connecting the silo of process building itas itsm and it operation coming together i thought telco could be really a complex market and industry and the customer probably using the lens of telco what are most frequent question and request are getting from your client yeah telco is interesting because it obviously one of the largest most complicated area in term of the number of asset the importance of the service to people people expect it to be on and running all of the time we are very much used to it almost a a utility and so that complexity those challenge bring a real focus on the importance of service operation and being able to manage high volume of change and complexity in these environment and keeping the resilience of the service high a well so i think telco is a really interesting area yeah it truly about customer experience a well weve a good service operation and good at customer experience i couldnt imagine the day that i would be dropped,Unlocking Service Operations with AI: Insights from Carey Blunt
16,16_3,about customer experience a well weve a good service operation and good at customer experience i couldnt imagine the day that i would be dropped off from the network now kerry how is fajusu approaching the service operation uniquely in the market yeah we have a lot of insight into a lot of industry and we that visibility across lot of industry and area mean that we are able to learn from how were implementing on one customer and take it to another customer and dealing with that complexity a a service provider ourselves really give u some real insight into the way customer organization operate often will go into a customer and talk to them about their operation and they will say oh yeah were unique were different our operation is totally different from everybody elses but actually theyre not always that different a they think they are you know there just really good good hygiene and good service operation practice that they can be applying and the way it apply to our own organization,Unlocking Service Operations with AI: Insights from Carey Blunt
16,16_4,know there just really good good hygiene and good service operation practice that they can be applying and the way it apply to our own organization that they can pick up and adopt regardless of the uniqueness of your industry right that is so true and then i have to bring up the next question it seems like we can go on you know a minute without talking about ai right it wa the top of my for your customer a prospect certainly come to ai service operation coming together yeah so obviously gen ai is the big topic at the moment right everyones talking different chat gpt and kind of thing those kind of technology have really opened up the ai conversation and customer always a bit a surprised to know that there they could be applying ai in their item and it operation already they think that gen ai is a new thing and like this is really cutting edge and actually the principle of applying machine learning for your event management and you know correlating all your event and thing like that,Unlocking Service Operations with AI: Insights from Carey Blunt
16,16_5,edge and actually the principle of applying machine learning for your event management and you know correlating all your event and thing like that are actually really not new technology right there thing that been around for a while and you know using ai in that context is actually a relatively easy step when youve got everything in the platform like service now so i think customer are really surprised and excited and really pleased that they can accelerate their journey with ai without having to learn kind of a load of new complex ai tool you know it all there ready for them to use and to carry out to lead a group of your insight that are thats all ai matter i wa sharing a lot of the customer the data machine learning using that will probably based on medical statistical model thats from probably 50 hundred year ago so really yeah yeah and i mean this whole excitement around gen ai or all the skill set that it brings u to human wa just wondering you know where your composition is,Unlocking Service Operations with AI: Insights from Carey Blunt
16,16_6,and i mean this whole excitement around gen ai or all the skill set that it brings u to human wa just wondering you know where your composition is really evolving around where how are we going to start off our ai journey yeah the whole ai journey it obviously difficult for customer always to know where to where to start right so yeah we could be applying ai at the service end we could be applying it at the operation and i always think that you need to start from where you are try to automate a much a possible and then if ai help you to automate then even better right so stick with stick with kind of first principle look at the operation content the data what event have you got coming in look at your service ticket whats the whats hot in term of service outage and event and then look to try and apply automation a much a possible and just follow those good principle and at some point youll go we could do this better with ai or we could we could completely get rid of this bit of work for,Unlocking Service Operations with AI: Insights from Carey Blunt
16,16_7,those good principle and at some point youll go we could do this better with ai or we could we could completely get rid of this bit of work for our people by having it automated by an ai and at that point thats the obviously the point where you need to start considering it but you dont have to consider it from day one right no it really about turning to become from a firefighter to be more proactive predictive youve been management youre talking about and probably about skilling operation a well i think this way ai and journey i come to send it absolutely yeah i just want to pivot the question a little bit i think we started talking about telco what other industry are you working with to apply service operation today there lot of industry where service operation can and should be important you know more than you think weve mentioned on telco just because of the size and complexity but you start to see it operation being applied in all sort of industry you know you could take for,Unlocking Service Operations with AI: Insights from Carey Blunt
16,16_8,on telco just because of the size and complexity but you start to see it operation being applied in all sort of industry you know you could take for example manufacturing and utility and also obviously the operational technology side a well so we talked about were talking about it really in most case but weve now got the capability to merge the it and ot world together and apply the great principle that we already apply to our it asset and our it operation to our ot operation a well so i think thats a really interesting exciting area and we have lot of customer conversation where theyre really interested in the principle of bringing those two thing together and managing them together and the same with security operation a well so it a gateway into really good security operation so every industry is really interested in their security you know cybersecurity is big on the agenda and so a a gateway into that conversation you know it operation is right there at the front of everyones mind,Unlocking Service Operations with AI: Insights from Carey Blunt
16,16_9,know cybersecurity is big on the agenda and so a a gateway into that conversation you know it operation is right there at the front of everyones mind yeah definitely i think were definitely seeing more attack not just on it system but also on all tv device the camera you know the production machinery a well yeah everythings connected now so weve got to worry about it yeah so the conversion of it and ots really become really real for your customer absolutely yes yeah and industry where you wouldnt have thought that traditionally they didnt need to worry about it right yeah but now you see the sort of cybersecurity attack on the news suddenly it right at the top of you know the cgos you know the csuite are really interested in it and so it coming up in conversation lot more and it wa really connected to u it not a game of software and a hardware suppose or the device that are you know you being used by for example industry like manufacturing utility that use a lot could you share like,Unlocking Service Operations with AI: Insights from Carey Blunt
16,16_10,suppose or the device that are you know you being used by for example industry like manufacturing utility that use a lot could you share like like probably you know possible example of manufacturing customer that you work with and then how they have benefited from it service operation yeah so for manufacturing customer particularly down time is obviously a big issue for them right production line is not running then youre losing money straight away and there a high level of sensitivity from you know factory floor manager they have traditionally been very kind of resistant to the it guy coming in and messing with their stuff right because the factory floor team are obviously incentivized to keep the factory floor running all the time and they dont want to hand over any control but you can start to see when you introduce service operation and you bring those factory floor manager into the fold and you could they can understand how they could reduce their down time or improve their,Unlocking Service Operations with AI: Insights from Carey Blunt
16,16_11,and you bring those factory floor manager into the fold and you could they can understand how they could reduce their down time or improve their productivity by playing the principle of it operation and service operation then you can get them on board right theyre interested suddenly a long a they can have the visibility through you know work space and thing like that then theyre all on board yeah and this is how traditionally like business department being organized it and then soot department often silo and this is where i think service now come from a service operation about connecting the people the system a well a the process what are the misconception that organization have for the approaching service operation that youre sending in your client on the market one of the thing we seek quite often is organization seeing some concept like say devops and they say okay were going to be a devops organization and i say to them where are you with your service operation how far are you,Unlocking Service Operations with AI: Insights from Carey Blunt
16,16_12,like say devops and they say okay were going to be a devops organization and i say to them where are you with your service operation how far are you with your itom journey and they go oh weve not implemented that yet and i say to them we need to get some basic principle going here right so let look at your data model let look at the consistency of the data let make sure that youve got good practice happening in your organization because you dont want to layer on a technology change and a organizational change like devops at the same time youre actually taking on far too much so let get your service operation your automation and improvement in what youve got today then let transform your organization to be a devops model later so just take thing slowly implement based on sort of simple principle let try and simplify let try and automate let try and optimize and then let look at the devops or sre or something like that in term of your organization definitely i think this is really about,Unlocking Service Operations with AI: Insights from Carey Blunt
16,16_13,try and optimize and then let look at the devops or sre or something like that in term of your organization definitely i think this is really about setting that whole foundation and we are talking about having really good cmdb and laying one topdown building block absolutely yeah really about the default process by selfclaiming for some of the year it like you know problem are a lot for j and god know why it coming around the corner and really need to have that visibility and also the actionable insight around our brown at yeah what do you think were hitting next when it come to service ops yeah i think therell always be this need to optimize and automate a much a possible weve obviously talked about ai i think were only just learning where all the use case are for ai so weve been doing some interesting thing for example at fjtc with visual ai so that will analyze picture and then have those feed into a service operation type landscape and so i think there technology like that that,Unlocking Service Operations with AI: Insights from Carey Blunt
16,16_14,ai so that will analyze picture and then have those feed into a service operation type landscape and so i think there technology like that that people havent really considered properly but which could provide some real benefit to their organization so i think those thing are exciting thing theyre new area that were opening up the eye of customer to see and i think thats probably more and more of those kind of ai related concept are going to happen and there more and more thing go to the cloud obviously cloud operation is becomes a much more important thing i think well continue to see more maturity in that area and more importance of managing your cloud asset alongside everything else those thing are going to be the thing that people are worrying about for the next few year im not sure about just the next few year probably the next decade that it probably is talking about carrie i mean ha there been a great conversation but just kind of like wanting to end of anything else you want to,Unlocking Service Operations with AI: Insights from Carey Blunt
16,16_15,that it probably is talking about carrie i mean ha there been a great conversation but just kind of like wanting to end of anything else you want to add especially for our client will all prospect of really about studying off their journey any advice what a gift there yeah i say dont be afraid and start simple right look at those foundational principle you know organization like fidgetes who come in and help you get it right from the start rather than learning by making them stake and having to go backwards and fix thing so yeah come and come and talk to a partner try and get that conversation going use their knowledge of previous implementation to make sure that your implementation go well thank you so much for joining u today and also for u to be a great partner a well a a customer of service now this ha been really a great conversation yeah thank you very much for having me it been really good and thank you to all of our listener please subscribe and share if you like what you,Unlocking Service Operations with AI: Insights from Carey Blunt

17,17_2,give you a short demonstration around some of the capability weve delivered out the box and youll find within size doe undo at least and just before we go im going to try and get five minute to give you a sneak peek of whats coming just around the corner with a yoke harmer at least so with that let get cracking so everybodys talking about ai everybodys looking to deliver an ai strategy across their organization and rightly so because ai is promising to solve all those complexity issue a were looking to drive change and innovation right the way across the enterprise and thats backed up by lot of different independent survey where were seeing lot of executive seeing the transformation effect there so gni i will have through 2027 but if you think about 2024 wa potentially in most organization did their to into ai and how it could be applied across their organization move fast forward into 2025 and it all about how can we ensure were getting a return on investment were going to deliver,SPM Academy: Now Assist and AI Agents for SPM
17,17_3,across their organization move fast forward into 2025 and it all about how can we ensure were getting a return on investment were going to deliver substantive value on our ai investment so for that we need to ensure that ai life up to the hype it delivers on it promise but the fact of the matter is looking at various different organization and certainly organization ive talked with over the last 12 80 month a lot feel theyre not really prepared in term of how they go about rolling out and adopting ai successfully across the organization and without successful adoption youre not going to get that return on investment and part of the problem there is the actual framework organization are looking to put in place in order to deliver ai across the organization how it allows them to roll it out but also how it allows it to track govern and ensure were not exposed to risk so what were going to look at first of all is spms rolling ensuring we get the value from delivering ai now we think,SPM Academy: Now Assist and AI Agents for SPM
17,17_4,ensure were not exposed to risk so what were going to look at first of all is spms rolling ensuring we get the value from delivering ai now we think about the building block you need to be successful in delivering your ai strategy where you need to have a vision what are we looking to achieve and one of the target where were going to look to put in place in order to measure success we need them to identify all those ai use case that we want to roll out across the business we want to bring them together we need to objectively assess them prioritize them and then from that move forward in term of planning out what that ai transformation roadmap look like and then looking in term of how we deliver all those initiative a were doing that weve got to link in with our enterprise architecture discipline we need to understand where ai is being deployed across the organization so that we can ensure we monitor any risk and we always stay compliant and ultimately a we go through this endtoend,SPM Academy: Now Assist and AI Agents for SPM
17,17_5,deployed across the organization so that we can ensure we monitor any risk and we always stay compliant and ultimately a we go through this endtoend process weve got to ensure were optimizing the value that ai is providing we need to be understanding what the value is being delivered and if we need to pivot plan we need to be able to do that now if you think about those five step it all scream the need for strategic portfolio management and thats because an ai transformation is just like any other transformation or strategic initiative that go across your organization and we know the importance of having a strategic portfolio management approach in the successful delivery of those strategic initiative so through capability like the strategic planning workspace which well see later on the ability to define what those priority are the thentoroam map our ai strategy and then track how were actually delivering on those priority and the value being created all through spm and we all know,SPM Academy: Now Assist and AI Agents for SPM
17,17_6,map our ai strategy and then track how were actually delivering on those priority and the value being created all through spm and we all know through spm we can deliver working lot of different way whether it traditional project agile work but if you think about an ai perspective lot of thing happen very quickly lot of little experiment may be happening in term of different ai technology being tested out across the organization before we do a full roll out these experiment are typically driven by ai incubation team and thats a perfect use case for collaborative work management which is a new capability we introduced in strategic portfolio management the ability to build bring those incubation team together very quickly to plan out what we need to do inside the experiment and also to expose that experiment onto our roadmap and any dependency it may have in thing we want to deliver in the future and finally with that link between spm and enterprise architecture we have that ability then,SPM Academy: Now Assist and AI Agents for SPM
17,17_7,it may have in thing we want to deliver in the future and finally with that link between spm and enterprise architecture we have that ability then to map and model how were looking to utilize ai across the organization both in our current state and our future state model by tying together enterprise architecture to strategic planning were able then to have a better view of our risk posture and ensure that were going to achieve compliance so that wa just quick insight in term of the importance of applying an spm approach to enable you to maximize the value of your ai strategy a you want to deliver it now were going to look at how were putting ai to work within strategic portfolio management now one of the key element and one of the key strength of service to our strategic portfolio management is it underpins the endtoend lifestyle from strategy through strategic planning portfolio planning all the way through to delivery and ultimately value realization and through that endtoend,SPM Academy: Now Assist and AI Agents for SPM
17,17_8,strategy through strategic planning portfolio planning all the way through to delivery and ultimately value realization and through that endtoend process there some key stakeholder that engage in utilising strategic portfolio management from business leader through pmo to project resource manager development team etc what were looking to do by applying now assist to the endtoend spm life cycle is to enable each one of those key persona to gain benefit through ai to make them more productive to help them make better decision and ultimately to fast track value through that endtoend lifestyle now you may have seen similar diagram in the past this is something i used to depict our endtoend cycle on how we looked at transform our strategy into delivering value whether it related to the business or is related to technology from strategic planning to portfolio planning to that delivery of work now what weve done through the zanadir release is look to apply ai across that endtoend life cycle,SPM Academy: Now Assist and AI Agents for SPM

17,17_11,now assist is going to do is ask me a series of question so it going to take the user through the demand and ask him all the thing that are pertinent to that type of request so let say we want to do auto categorisation or product feedback and a i enter my information now assist will then look at why do we need that the new product manager to react faster and im taking through those various question i can even have thing that a im adding in my request im going to align this to the various key strategic initiative so this is aligned to customer centric product innovation im going to say this is probably going to be of medium level effort and then what ill do just for time today im going to skip some of the nonmandatory question around cost and around benefit and then what now assist will provide me with is a summary of what ive entered in term of asking those question now ive made a mistake there in term of the level of effort so i can say i want to make a change and in natural language,SPM Academy: Now Assist and AI Agents for SPM
17,17_12,of asking those question now ive made a mistake there in term of the level of effort so i can say i want to make a change and in natural language i can say change size to large so now assist will go away and make that change so we can see in term of the level of effort thats now changed to large im happy with that im going to submit it and thats the demand now in my demand pipeline so that enables u to get everybody across the organization participating in that demand intake process because it making it easier for people to use now if im a product manager i can be in a strategic planning workspace and using our feedback capability and one of the thing i do on a daytoday basis i get lot of email from customer around feedback around our product so in product feedback this is giving me visibility around the product im looking after in my business customer portal i can see the category of feedback ive received where that feedback ha come from ive even got thing like sentiment analysis to,SPM Academy: Now Assist and AI Agents for SPM
17,17_13,customer portal i can see the category of feedback ive received where that feedback ha come from ive even got thing like sentiment analysis to look at now everybodys talking about ai and how we get ai into product so i can drill down into that section i can look at all the ai related feedback and if you think about the typical whirlwind today id have to look at all of those email individual go in read them then assess them and decide what i want to do a very timeconsuming process what i can do here i can quickly look at selecting all the feedback item im looking at i can click on my summary button and what now a system will now do is do a summary of all of those feedback item bring me back a bulleted list of the thing i need to know about and immediately then i can put that information from now assist into action so i can link it to a product idea or i could click demand directly or an epic or a project or whatever it is and drive forward an action thats information from now assist if,SPM Academy: Now Assist and AI Agents for SPM
17,17_14,idea or i could click demand directly or an epic or a project or whatever it is and drive forward an action thats information from now assist if we move forward into the process let look in term of enterprise agile planning now throughout that into process you will see on the slide actual previously the ability to add ai in the context of document so right the way across to do portfolio management weve introduced what we call the doc tab so this is enterprise agile planning im looking at the agile work from my business customer portal team and i can see all the epic currently being worked on a i drill into doc i can see ive got a couple of document there one of which is release note a i drill into that document this will give me information around whats in those release note and i can see ive been at message to actually shorten the introduction paragraph and with doc these are fully collaborative so other people can come in and collaborate around creating these document and we can,SPM Academy: Now Assist and AI Agents for SPM
17,17_15,paragraph and with doc these are fully collaborative so other people can come in and collaborate around creating these document and we can reference other information on the platform like referencing record et cetera now what i could do i could pick the paragraph up i could look at now assist and i could click on short summarize or elaborate or if i want to summarize the entire document i can simply click on summarize and that will provide me a summary of the overall release note document which i can take that test and actually put in the document should i wish to do so now doc is available right the way across spm inside the project workspace and inside the strategic planning workspace inside product feedback and that use of ai is available right the way across now the final use case were going to look at now is something we rolled out in the november store release it called the project insight email so if im a project manager working inside the project workspace and im looking at my,SPM Academy: Now Assist and AI Agents for SPM
17,17_16,the november store release it called the project insight email so if im a project manager working inside the project workspace and im looking at my project ive got the ability to set up an email project summary and what i can do here is set a schedule by which i want this summary to be created and what will happen a that email is scheduled now assist will then generate me the content relating to whats happening in the project so just a an example what im just going to do here is just bring up an example of what that email look like and we can see it broken down into a series of section and what now assist will do is generate this format of email and with inside each section well provide information and link to various element of the project give me insight to whats happening with inside my project without me actually having to come into service now to understand whats going on and should i want to action anything that the email is telling me ive got the link ill take me back into the,SPM Academy: Now Assist and AI Agents for SPM
17,17_17,service now to understand whats going on and should i want to action anything that the email is telling me ive got the link ill take me back into the solution so a very powerful way of providing proactive insight for project manager utilising now assist now let go back to the powerpoint and what were going to talk to now is whats coming whats around the corner and what im going to introduce now is something were looking to roll out with inside your karma around ai agent so very much where weve been in 2024 is around phase three of ai around conversation or workload and you saw through those example that i showcase quickly there where the human is actually engaging with now assist asking now assist to perform action in order to help that persona do their particular work now fast forward into 2025 and everybodys talking about a genty ai and the use of ai agent this promise to be the most transformational thing to happen to the spm life cycle for 30 year and ive been working in spm for,SPM Academy: Now Assist and AI Agents for SPM
17,17_18,the use of ai agent this promise to be the most transformational thing to happen to the spm life cycle for 30 year and ive been working in spm for all of that time it a really exciting prospect where we can have agent proactively working and helping facilitate persona right away across the end of the process so what doe that actually look like so from an spm standpoint what were looking to do is provide ai agent that are persona driven so whether the target is towards an executive or portfolio owner or a project a resource manager were effectively looking to create these agent to actually perform specific activity or to understand specific use case and whats exciting about them is youre effectively creating a system of agent those agent are going to work together a a team in order to help analyze activity provide suggestion and recommendation to the persona and then actually take action based on what the human suggest need to happen now if we look at what the structure of an ai agent,SPM Academy: Now Assist and AI Agents for SPM
17,17_19,to the persona and then actually take action based on what the human suggest need to happen now if we look at what the structure of an ai agent look like im going to take you in a moment and give you a sneak peek of the ai agent studio now the structure is essentially we define a use case what is the business problem or the activity were looking to address and were going to provide some natural language description of what that look like what well then do is define a trigger of what will kick off agent looking at this particular use case now it could be user driven but the power of ai agent is in that trigger beam machine driven something happening in the database a record being created a field being updated an api call whatever that may be and from that trigger that will kick into what we call the ai agent orchestrator now what the ai agent orchestrator will do will identify from that trigger if this particular use case irrelevant and then from that will look then to trigger off the,SPM Academy: Now Assist and AI Agents for SPM
17,17_20,orchestrator will do will identify from that trigger if this particular use case irrelevant and then from that will look then to trigger off the specific ai agent needed to actually work on solving that particular business problem now the ai agent themselves think about them a having specific job to do and again ill show you an example in a moment but what theyll do is one of them might be to collect information one might be presenting information back to the persona one might be to actually take an action like create a record or something like that now the key element of those ai agent a theyre looking to do their task their activity will be defined through a prompt and then associated with those agent will be what we call tool and these tool of what the agent will utilize to interact with information whether it now assist skill or whether it script a we do in a state business or using workflow using thing like raguay were looking at different thing with inside documentation those,SPM Academy: Now Assist and AI Agents for SPM
17,17_21,it script a we do in a state business or using workflow using thing like raguay were looking at different thing with inside documentation those tool will be utilized by the agent to help and perform that task in order to help u solve that business problem now let quickly jump in and see what that look like so now were taking you into the ai agent studio so a i say this is now something well be rolled out with inside your carman the example im going to take you through now are just example ive created a weve gone through but sure sort of the direction of travel that were looking to do from an ai agent perspective within size strategic portfolio management so the example im going to use is around application rationalization because this is one thats got a lot of people excited in various different industry sector the first step is we define our use case so a i can see one use case application rationalization using ai agent to automatically assist architect in rationalizing their,SPM Academy: Now Assist and AI Agents for SPM
17,17_22,define our use case so a i can see one use case application rationalization using ai agent to automatically assist architect in rationalizing their business application so i drill into my use case weve got a description of what the use case is and we got some ai instruction in a basic prompt telling me whats going to happen here in term of how this use case is going to happen so it going to be kicked off by an objective and objective and then what were going to ask it to do is identify the overall analysis of our business application portfolio to give u some cost information the next step will be then to identify some candidate to help u meet those cost target and then on approval were going to create some demand record now the trigger we define in this case is just a simple bigger based on some information from a kpr and an okr within size spm where weve got a changing target so it going to recognize that change in target which will then kick off this particular use case but a i say,SPM Academy: Now Assist and AI Agents for SPM
17,17_23,spm where weve got a changing target so it going to recognize that change in target which will then kick off this particular use case but a i say that trigger can be any activity and then youll notice at the bottom here weve got three agent that are related to activity that were going to perform in this use case so the first agent is to go away and find me that portfolio cost information the next one will be to identify my rationalization candidate and the third agent is all about taking action creating those demand record so if youre looking in term of say let take the cost analysis agent again we describe what the agent is we give a description of what the agent is for and what it expertise is and then we provide a prompt in term of what were asking the agent to do and how it there to get it information and how it should be then presenting it information so a simple prompt language ill add to that a i mentioned we then provide a series of tool in this case ive got a single tool this,SPM Academy: Now Assist and AI Agents for SPM
17,17_24,it information so a simple prompt language ill add to that a i mentioned we then provide a series of tool in this case ive got a single tool this one is a script but we can add different tool and they could be script now it the skill using retrieval augmented generation ie for going information with this documentation or using workflow ie flow designer ticket separate flow to support so lot of different tool and you can have multiple tool supporting each of the agent so from creating that structure what you can then do is take it into testing and thats what im just going to take you crossing into here so prior to the session today what i did wa going to testing identified the use case we wanted to test ie application rationalization i gave it the instruction in term of what i wanted to mimic ie in this case were going to reduce the legacy spend for each application by 50 and then i clicked on test inside the studio then what happens is on the left hand side you have a mimic of what,SPM Academy: Now Assist and AI Agents for SPM
17,17_25,spend for each application by 50 and then i clicked on test inside the studio then what happens is on the left hand side you have a mimic of what you would see in the analysis panel from the information that the use case will provide and a you can see we can see at the top of the first agent thats gone through and it provided me with that analysis of the cost information around our portfolio so total cost of application what our new rationalization cost target actually mean i reduced by 50 the fact weve already got 8 milleens worth of saving are already identified so it telling me i need to find an extra 5 milleens worth of saving what is then gone on to do that second agent is kicked in and identified a series of application and provided information per application including the potential cost saving of that application so identify what those candidate could be in order to help me reach that 53 million from a saving perspective in fact it identified a potential 124 so from here i can,SPM Academy: Now Assist and AI Agents for SPM
17,17_26,those candidate could be in order to help me reach that 53 million from a saving perspective in fact it identified a potential 124 so from here i can sort of engage with that response and it the other thing i should say some of these are being identified a critical business system so we can see for example our workday system is a critical business system we probably dont need to get rid of that so i can say remove critical business system for example so i can actually mimic what would happen inside the panel and the agency of kicking that central area will then show how the various agent are engaging with each other so i can see how the orchestration is communicating with the different agent and on the right hand side ive got full visibility in term of whats happened and the thought process that ha gone on with the agent a they go through so if i look at these various element it give me a view of activity that have happened and the thing that it been asked to do and this is really,SPM Academy: Now Assist and AI Agents for SPM
17,17_27,so if i look at these various element it give me a view of activity that have happened and the thing that it been asked to do and this is really useful in term of how you create new agent and a youre looking at how the agent are running you can actually go through and identify how those agent work so a you can see ai agent are going to be a really powerful capability and just to finish off my final slide and just to let you know a part of what were looking to do with inside your car or subject to safe over will be our first ai agent that will be around project testimonial tree so an agent aimed at the project manager and it will look to provide a project manager with insight to whats happening with inside their project and summarise information around the project task their resource and milestone a thing happen within inside the project so if youre thinking in term of the great step forward we made with the project insight email summary that were releasing november the ai agent will,SPM Academy: Now Assist and AI Agents for SPM
17,17_28,so if youre thinking in term of the great step forward we made with the project insight email summary that were releasing november the ai agent will take that to the next level by providing this inside a thing happen and notify the project manager so look out for that a part of what weve ended deliver in your car so with that deborah im going to hand back to you thank you james that wa absolutely awesome i do feel smarter and definitely more excited about all these great ai capability we do have a few event and resource to share that were a real fine to help all first of all on march 13th and 14th were thrilled to once again offer our bionuel spm vision series youll experience discussion and demo from our team at service now and customer like you on how you can gain value from spm and 21st is our bionuel enterprise architecture vision series with a similar format to the spm vision series and then next our next spm academy is whats new in yokohama for spm enterprise architecture and,SPM Academy: Now Assist and AI Agents for SPM

18,18_1,enables team to quickly triage and resolve issue issue that are otherwise hard to spot in unstructured and out of context metric log and event this design is great for people like amelia who prefer an enhanced view when working with alert so they can stay focused and stay in the moment it can filter on thing such a alert severity configuration item assignment group and so forth being able to add or remove field from the filter view give team the flexibility to customize the workspace for maximum efficiency amelia team is also leveraging alert tag which are generated by extracting key from additional information in event created and event field mapping these tag can be used to further correlate alert to reduce noise you can see theyve set up a filter so they can sort by data center location tag since team member are responsible for different area once created and saved custom filter can be shared so others on the team can quickly get on the same page alert can also be filtered by,IT Operations Management (ITOM): Predictive AIOps & Event Management
18,18_2,area once created and saved custom filter can be shared so others on the team can quickly get on the same page alert can also be filtered by impacted service today amelia only care about the payment gateway service so she can quickly narrow her view to only show those alert public action can be performed on one or more alert or group of alert amelia can act on all the alert related to payment gateway in just a few click and most importantly this can all be done from a single page within the service operation workspace all alert associated with payment processing have been consolidated into two group alert configuration item with different source and metric have been grouped together based on the learned pattern item event management ha discovered pattern are formed based on repetition of the same alert coming together repeatedly in multiple time window using this analysis event management concludes that these alert are related other alert from different monitoring tool are oftentimes,IT Operations Management (ITOM): Predictive AIOps & Event Management
18,18_3,time window using this analysis event management concludes that these alert are related other alert from different monitoring tool are oftentimes symptom of the issue and not necessarily the cause only focusing on these kind of alert is a very reactive way to troubleshoot and resolve issue you can see that the second group alert came in long before the critical alert where the service went down thats because this group alert includes alert from healthlog analytics or hla a major component of service now ai ops by analyzing trend in anomaly and log healthlog analytics provides an early warning system about problem to come these first warning alert show how hla caught the problem first allowing amelia and team time to be proactive and to help prevent future failure in this alert we can see that there an increase in log associated with ii which is the web hosting environment for the payment gateway service from this alert amelia see that there a sharp increase in the volume of log,IT Operations Management (ITOM): Predictive AIOps & Event Management
18,18_4,ii which is the web hosting environment for the payment gateway service from this alert amelia see that there a sharp increase in the volume of log associated with the web host and thanks to hla she can see that 90 of the log contain warning message a true sign of trouble sharing this kind of insight from log can be a very manual and timeconsuming process without proper ai ops tool change to any associated configuration item are tracked through the itsm change management workflow and a a result they can be referenced here sharing information like this between team and workflow is a key aspect of the service now service operation approach in this case it look like a devops orchestration task might have caused an unintended issue with the payment gateway service thanks to what shes been able to quickly determine using the service operation workspace amelia now ha a clear idea of the root cause and can work with the devops team to resolve so far weve seen how itam event management can,IT Operations Management (ITOM): Predictive AIOps & Event Management
18,18_5,workspace amelia now ha a clear idea of the root cause and can work with the devops team to resolve so far weve seen how itam event management can combine alert from multiple source which help speed up and streamline troubleshooting effort weve also explored a little bit about the benefit of healthwog analytics but you may be asking yourself how did amelia and the team configure those connection with other data source in the first place or what type of integration doe servicenow support the new integration launch pad provides an incontext intuitive way to configure such connection amelia can either search for a data source she want to add or filter by connection type she simply selects on one of the outofbox integration to configure and then follows the wizard setting up a new outofbox integration can be done in just a few step first shell enter a name and then set up any custom tag tag allow for better filtering and can be used in the express list view like we saw earlier a well a,IT Operations Management (ITOM): Predictive AIOps & Event Management
18,18_6,enter a name and then set up any custom tag tag allow for better filtering and can be used in the express list view like we saw earlier a well a other dashboard within it operation management so shell go ahead and add the location tag that she and the team have been using before activating amelia copy the url she will need to pair the integration from the aws side and after doing so amelia and the team can then interact with aws alert along with all other source from within the itam event management system she can even set up a custom connection in case what shes looking for is not listed or she ha a homegrown application that she would like to incorporate into event management today amelia is going to go ahead and set up a connection with the team new pingdum monitoring system just like with the outofbox setup she ha the same option to add custom tag using tag in this way ha many benefit including better visibility and better understanding of business context when working with alert,IT Operations Management (ITOM): Predictive AIOps & Event Management

19,19_1,queue we then showed how in parallel the operation engineer wa able to quickly determine probable root cause of the outage and trigger a service degradation so let pick the demo up from there nora griffith is an employee who us the order status application called portia online in her daytoday work shes having issue completing her work and so shes going to check in and try to get some help remember even though shes using this from the servicenow web interface she could also use microsoft team skype facebook workplace or other collaboration platform let just type in the summary of the issue and thanks to the natural language understanding model virtual agent can pick out keywords and phrase and suggest the right workflow in this case noras team ha configured a set of additional question to help troubleshoot the different area related to the ordering system now nora ha confirmed that there is an issue with the order status process which is used in the portia online service she doesnt,"AI-Powered Service Operations Part 2 - collaborate, deflect and resolve"
19,19_2,the ordering system now nora ha confirmed that there is an issue with the order status process which is used in the portia online service she doesnt need to open up a new incident because she can already see that there a ticket open this is what we mean by deflection alerting employee that there an ongoing issue help stop the inflow of new ticket allowing service operation team to concentrate on troubleshooting and fixing the issue instead of managing more and more ticket now let continue looking at thing a roberto hopper a member of noras it operation team from operator workspace we can see the order status service is in a critical state a we saw in the previous video related alert have been grouped together by itam event management let just go back into the group alert so we can continue troubleshooting a we look for a way to resolve the issue with the order status service the first alert that came in wa from healthlog analytics this hla alert is letting u know there are some,"AI-Powered Service Operations Part 2 - collaborate, deflect and resolve"
19,19_3,the issue with the order status service the first alert that came in wa from healthlog analytics this hla alert is letting u know there are some anomaly with the log basically unusual pattern or something that happened recently that hasnt happened before if i open up this option we can do a deep dive into the log on the first line we can see detail on a suspect log associated with the window host x42 opening up log viewer allows u to really dive deep into these log and understand what were seeing based on what wa triggered by hla we can see more about pattern recognition both out of the box and pattern that are learned over time thanks to the machine learning of healthlog analytics now let go back to the group alert and speaking of machine recognizing pattern and helping u troubleshoot let click on probable root cause and we can see another example of this two recent change are flagged a possible cause of the issue were seeing with the order status service the bottom one appears to be,"AI-Powered Service Operations Part 2 - collaborate, deflect and resolve"
19,19_4,example of this two recent change are flagged a possible cause of the issue were seeing with the order status service the bottom one appears to be a schedule change by robertos dev ops team but the top one is unauthorized so let take a look at that scrolling down we can see that in this emergency change someone ha changed the sequel trace flag to true from false this is very helpful when troubleshooting sql but sometimes this can cause disk space issue if you forget to turn it off because log are much larger when this is enabled there one additional step we could perform to take a look at the log but in the essence of time im going to skip to robertos conclusion that disk space is filling on the sql server and thats whats causing a cascading effect to the order status service roberto is using all the information within these page within the service now platform to reach this conclusion let go back to the group alert and ill show you how we can trigger the fix through flow designer,"AI-Powered Service Operations Part 2 - collaborate, deflect and resolve"
19,19_5,the service now platform to reach this conclusion let go back to the group alert and ill show you how we can trigger the fix through flow designer directly from the service now platform first roberto decides to bring up the agent assist function to look for helpful article related to disk space here one related to clearing log on a window server seems appropriate right so let attach that to the ticket roberto will put in a note about his finding giving some insight to the team into what he thinking now let open up action so we can actually fix the issue thats the whole point right were trying to fix the problem now this is one of my favorite thing about the service now platform in this scenario in this case with flow designer we actually have the tool to reach out and fix issue on affected ci which is great without such functionality wed still have to manually remove log expand disk space thing like that and clicking on the run remediation button the platform actually ha a prebuilt,"AI-Powered Service Operations Part 2 - collaborate, deflect and resolve"

21,21_1,of all our different ai solution and how to get started in your company this video is recorded and then posted in our youtube channel thats the channel of the now community and on this channel there also a lot of other academy and video that are posted very good resource to get to and finally if you want to join in a partnership to share some of your data so that we can advance the field of ai feel free to reach out to that email address for the global ai innovation program and see what you can provide to help advance our ai product a always in those session we try to cover whats existing in our product and whats available but in case you ask question or we wan na share some of the roadmap with you always keep in mind that we have to share the safe hub or notice with you and if in case we make a forward looking statement meaning that we talk about something thats not available in the product yet you always have to reach out to your accounting before making a final purchasing decision,Task Intelligence for ITSM
21,21_2,talk about something thats not available in the product yet you always have to reach out to your accounting before making a final purchasing decision so that you are aware of what youre buying if you are new to ai academy here are some of the basic of the academy it content that we provide for you so we bring you fresh idea to give you a better understanding of our product and practical guidance a i mentioned earlier the session is recorded and then we post that on the youtube channel for our community and finally if you are here with u thats a great opportunity for you to ask your question so feel free to use the qa panel in zoom to ask your question and well make sure to answer those a we go the session today is organized with an overview of our product and then were gon na spend most of the time working through an exercise which is a bit of a demo of the product and guide you towards getting started with the product and then well save some time for qa and today with u is a peksha,Task Intelligence for ITSM
21,21_3,bit of a demo of the product and guide you towards getting started with the product and then well save some time for qa and today with u is a peksha to talk to u about task intelligence for itsn very very exciting and now a peksha ill give it to you so hello everyone this is a picture they will from india so i saw a couple of folk joining from india a well so hello everyone good evening and good morning to all the people joining from u and good afternoon for the european folk out there so im the senior principal product manager with it service management unit and i take care of all the ai aml portfolio for itsn code product here and with you to demo or take you through the task intelligence for itsn a a first release the release in third on third of hour so when you hear task intelligence i know most of you would think that what is this is it different from predictive intelligence is it just the name which is changing or it really something changing at a line so the good news is the,Task Intelligence for ITSM
21,21_4,is it different from predictive intelligence is it just the name which is changing or it really something changing at a line so the good news is the task intelligence is quite different from predictive intelligence thats the reason we are doing the session along with multiple customer and how the task intelligence is different the complete way how we built task intelligence use case out of the box for our customer the way we think about these use case is different the task intelligence is a purpose built ai for business user when i say that each and every word make sense what those meaning is that business user mean it brings business outcome driven versus technology a well it mean that we dont say that i use classification for this we say okay if we want to do incident categorization for all ai capability which we can use in task intelligence the way we think about the use case to do it different also the ai ml model which us if you use deep learning ml model which give better reason,Task Intelligence for ITSM
21,21_5,the way we think about the use case to do it different also the ai ml model which us if you use deep learning ml model which give better reason based on our analysis which we did in house based on multiple clone customer data that and it support multiple language on text attachment and so on and so forth it also come with a task intelligence admin console user experience which help business user when i say business user it mean that the admin business user doe not require to have the expert ai knowledge or they do not require to have a data scientist knowledge they just require to have their own business knowledge and then task intelligence admin console will take care of working them through after each step and then deploy the model i will definitely demo that part today so that would be more clear apart from that the biggest value add it will bring to the existing customer of the artificial intelligence task intelligence support multifield detection model so you will see in my demo,Task Intelligence for ITSM
21,21_6,it will bring to the existing customer of the artificial intelligence task intelligence support multifield detection model so you will see in my demo that i would be creating single model to detect multiple view on the incident so it very low on maintenance it high on performance and it very very easy to configure with all these benefit i now go to the exercise next slide please you like it so this is the demo script which are the exercise script which i would be taking you through so consider the company where employee were not at all satisfied by the service performance now the service just manager and realize this situation and go to their business leader and add money to understand what should we do because this reduction and satisfaction if also due to the higher increase in the mttr so this admin and business analysis decide to use task intelligence to solve this issue the task that we intelligence admin console provides humanfriendly interface to train a is deploy and monitor,Task Intelligence for ITSM
21,21_7,task intelligence to solve this issue the task that we intelligence admin console provides humanfriendly interface to train a is deploy and monitor the model so a i said earlier this admin and business analyst who do not have very great knowledge of the aiml can also deploy the model which they require for their business in the production once they do that they need to go to recommended action framework to to certain configuration to show these recommendation on the service operation work once the service operation workspace start doing the prediction eventually what happened is it increased the agent productivity hence reduces the mttr and at the end overall employee satisfaction score increased now you will see that hey should do configuring something in task intelligence admin console then going to recommend action to take care of how it show on ui is too much of configuration you talk about simplicity but look like there are two framework which i need to go and then do something,Task Intelligence for ITSM
21,21_8,it show on ui is too much of configuration you talk about simplicity but look like there are two framework which i need to go and then do something the good news is we take care of task intelligence and the committed action configuration out to the world by autotrained model on your production what doe that mean to moment you download task intelligence for itsm plugin on your production instance it autotrained the model for assignment group configuration item and service on your data provided you have the amount of data in your system and then also it ha an automatic configuration in the recommended action shipped out of the box so that just downloading of one plugin will start the prediction in background mode when i say background mode it doesnt mean that whenever an incident get created the prediction will happen but it will not show on the ui because you definitely dont want to surprise your agent and then let admin know that okay something is happening or you are allowing that so,Task Intelligence for ITSM
21,21_9,the ui because you definitely dont want to surprise your agent and then let admin know that okay something is happening or you are allowing that so with this autotrained model you will be able to start predicting in the background mode by just downloading the plugin and how all these thing work now ill take you through the demo a i take you through the demo i would like to answer julian question so julian asks that it look similar to the predictive intelligence classification whats the difference here third question julian i thank you that you are this question a a set predictive intelligence require you to create three different model to predict three different field but in task intelligence a single model will be applicable to predict these three field thats one the second is it support multiple language a well a it very easy to consider a you will go through you will see the type of power ui experience it brings the type of power it give to the admin is very much you do not require,Task Intelligence for ITSM
21,21_10,a you will go through you will see the type of power ui experience it brings the type of power it give to the admin is very much you do not require to have that technical knowledge to understand the precision the recall which is there in predictive intelligence to understand whether your model is working fine or not in task intelligence it very plain simple english so any business user who doe not have aiml capability or understanding can also deploy this model so these are the two very big benefit which task intelligence brings with it okay so if you are on utah instance so you have five patch five and above or vancoa instance and you downloaded the task intelligence for idsm plugin you will see this task intelligence for idsm in your file navigator in the task intelligence for idsm you will see two subsection a sub menu one is setup and one is monitoring so this is also one of the benefit which you get with the task intelligence that you can monitor how your model is working so if,Task Intelligence for ITSM
21,21_11,one is monitoring so this is also one of the benefit which you get with the task intelligence that you can monitor how your model is working so if you remember it just a couple of minute before i said that the auto training model will start with deploy your model in the background mode so in the background mode it will show you how it is actually performing without showing the recommendation on ui so you can actually come here and say okay my model it wa five time agent ha accepted the prediction it mean and 21 time it ha not how the prediction wa replaced how it is doing and all those thing you can see here even in setup we have certain matrix to give you a quick snapshot about your performance of the model but that in monitoring you can do a thorough analysis okay so in the task intelligence for idsm set up module you will see out of the box you will shift this model idsm out of the box task intelligence solution this is an empty model which we see out of the box so that the moment,Task Intelligence for ITSM
21,21_12,box you will shift this model idsm out of the box task intelligence solution this is an empty model which we see out of the box so that the moment you download this product login in production this model run and get trained on your own data so that it predicts the value based on your own data automatically i will work it through what this is this but for example you do not want to say predict these three field you can always go to this template which we shipped out of the box and created new model add your own field which you want to predict and train access and deploy your model let me work you through what we shipped out of the box so once you come here you will see the model name you will see the output table it mean that on what table i need to train the data so my training data is out of the box which we shipped this the data should be false in per the closed and resolved incident and i want to train this data on my v so i just want to train this data on last 12 month what all,Task Intelligence for ITSM
21,21_13,be false in per the closed and resolved incident and i want to train this data on my v so i just want to train this data on last 12 month what all field i want to predict so i want to predict the assignment group configuration item and service now what all field i want to give u an input for predicting that so my input table is incident and the input here is a description and short description this is also one of the difference are existing customer can know that in existing predictive intelligence we just need short description whereas task intelligence given it deep learning and long text support model the description field also can be sent a an input and we have seen in our testing that combination of these two actually provides for better result and then similar to predictive intelligence a somebody mentioned the number of record which is required for you to train the model is 10000 and i guess the customer who are know knowledgeable about ai ml know that these record is the,Task Intelligence for ITSM
21,21_14,which is required for you to train the model is 10000 and i guess the customer who are know knowledgeable about ai ml know that these record is the number of record the more the better the merrier is always better for your model to get trained so once we decide this we can launch the training and see how it working so it show that till today when i deployed this model in your past data which is last 12 month it would have predicted 47000 300 and five field for you which is a great number to tell how you would have helped your service this agent in entering the correct data into the system now we will see how the model is actually performing a of now so we will see okay for this service it performing quite better because 75000 percent of the time what model predicted is what agent ha actually written 25 it is deferred which is okay for assignment group i see it 50 percent so i might want to go with just recommendation instead of what to fill but a i see the service is doing far better,Task Intelligence for ITSM
21,21_15,group i see it 50 percent so i might want to go with just recommendation instead of what to fill but a i see the service is doing far better i can say that okay i dont want my agent to manually fill it you can fill the service directly into the field and configuration item is also what 4159 so still keep at it a recommendation in case if youre not confident for example in case of configuration item that hey i dont want to do any prediction on ui i just say that hey do only monitor only it mean at the back end it will predict but it will not show anything on the ui so let me show you all three for the exercise purpose that for service we are doing bottom fill for assignment group it recommendation and for configuration item because it less than 50 i just want to monitor how im what are the performing over the time so that i can come here in future if it the performance improves now i can see when continue it will give a quick snapshot about what all i have done and it will say deploy,Task Intelligence for ITSM
21,21_16,in future if it the performance improves now i can see when continue it will give a quick snapshot about what all i have done and it will say deploy great so im already deployed it a i said you do not need to go to recommended action a this out of the box rule ha already mapped with the task intelligence room so let me show you where it taken up so this is the resource generator of the recommendation of the action and here i would say that i want to play these three thing and here in the resource generator is somewhere where i have mapped this okay till the time it come let me give you a live demo so let me create an incident in the service operation workspace so you will ask me that is service operation workspace is a mandatory for u to use task intelligence i would say no you can still go ahead and use our existing platform user experience with the task intelligence but you would not be able to utilize the power of how you want to show the recommendation it mean whether you want to,Task Intelligence for ITSM
21,21_17,with the task intelligence but you would not be able to utilize the power of how you want to show the recommendation it mean whether you want to show a a recommendation or auto spill and all these thing only happens in service operation workspace so i highly recommend strongly recommend that if you are willing to use task intelligence you also use service operation workspace 30 and above so here is where i have mapped for example this con this generator type is mapped to this solution so this solution on the task intelligence is pointing to this rule and then this rule is responsible to populate these on the service operation workspace and how service operation work they show u let me work with this so ill say email not working i will also say the morning i the moment i tab out thats the beauty of service operation workspace which doe not come with any other experience the moment you tab out please note that you have not created the incident yet it mean that a service desk agent who,Task Intelligence for ITSM
21,21_18,come with any other experience the moment you tab out please note that you have not created the incident yet it mean that a service desk agent who is just typing in the short description and description the moment he tab out to enter some other value he will be shown these suggestion now i want to walk you through what all we have done and the preference in the task intelligence admin console so we said service auto populate it mean that whatever is predicted i want to auto populate it here again it just that i want my agent to have a quick view and also save their time so thats the reason im out of populating agent can always change it is the more configuration item a the performance wa risen 50 i said hey dont predict just do the monitoring in the background mode so that i want to watch it over the time so you dont see anything here yet and for the assignment group a it wa 50 i said just recommend so just recommending below the field that according to the i am the assignment group,Task Intelligence for ITSM
21,21_19,and for the assignment group a it wa 50 i said just recommend so just recommending below the field that according to the i am the assignment group should do perfect it up to the agent whether to honor this suggestion or override it so these are the three thing which you have predicted to task intelligence and in these three mode and also key note that the incident is not a safe it mean it not yet created completely but i am well run in background and gave the suggestion so that even the incident creation process not just the triage process the incident creation process also become swift it get created with correct data so that the incident get categorized in a right format thats it from my site from the discussion or for the developer im happy to answer any question thank you very much we have somebody in the chat asking again if it only available for service operation workspace so if you could repeat maybe what you said about word available sure so a i said service operation work,Task Intelligence for ITSM
21,21_20,available for service operation workspace so if you could repeat maybe what you said about word available sure so a i said service operation work face which strongly recommend that you use service operation work face if you would like to use task intelligence for itsm because you would be able to use the complete power of both the product in service operation for faith you will be able to call task intelligence prediction even record creating an incident this beautiful power is not there in our native native ui or the platform ui which you call one that difference the second difference is these these feature where you want to show some a auto populate some a recommended these two is also not you not available in our native ui but prediction are available so whenever an incident get saved it will get saved based on the predicted value from task intelligence but thats exactly similar to what predictive intelligence also doe with the native your current ui so the beauty of task,Task Intelligence for ITSM
21,21_21,value from task intelligence but thats exactly similar to what predictive intelligence also doe with the native your current ui so the beauty of task intelligence will definitely enhance the use service operation work face great thank you there are also a few question around whether we could use that in sub production so if you want to answer that and a well i would like to pray to provide one best practice around that just to answer the question with that be available in sub production yes but subtraction auto training capability would not be available auto training capability key the moment you download the plugin the model get auto train on your own data this part is only available in the production but you can you can have this plugin on the sub broad train it manually see how it work and all that exactly right great the thats the one best practice i want to provide everybody here and we covered for it the same for task intelligence for csm it applies here to itsm a well when you,Task Intelligence for ITSM
21,21_22,best practice i want to provide everybody here and we covered for it the same for task intelligence for csm it applies here to itsm a well when you train your model in a sub broad environment really make sure that the data you have in your sub broad environment is refreshed is up to date is matching what you have in production otherwise youll be training a model on on the other is not realistic and you would not get good result in when you move the model to production yeah a picture we have two more question in the chat would this work with universal request great question so a of now this would work only with the incident but i would take that feedback back and see how quickly we can bring task intelligence on universal request in our own lab great thanks and another question came in which algorithm are used for prediction by ti sure so a of task intelligence us enhanced classification in the backend so thats the reason we a you see we shipped our first use case which is the,Task Intelligence for ITSM
21,21_23,sure so a of task intelligence us enhanced classification in the backend so thats the reason we a you see we shipped our first use case which is the categorization of the incident form a of now but going forward we would like to bring other use case such a showing similar kb similar incident also on that state intelligence but a of now for our first release in office we support this one use case and there were a few question again when which release wa that supported so you mentioned you talk to give the patch version again so task intelligence for idea and can be downloaded for you to patch five and above and when go and service operation work for three dot o version would be required for task intelligence and the recommended action which i demo it if the plugin name or the store app called advanced recommended action for it sm so by the way task intelligence do take care of downloading that but a a a a check i would recommend our customer to see that if they have also downloaded,Task Intelligence for ITSM
21,21_24,the way task intelligence do take care of downloading that but a a a a check i would recommend our customer to see that if they have also downloaded advanced to come reduction for it sm a well then they would be testing this complete end to end product in this abroad abroad anyway a like mentioned nilima ha created an awesome start guide in our community forum to give you an idea about the version all the role are quiet and i would strongly suggest to go through that absolutely i just shared the link for for those of u who are with u nilima is helping u with the question today and shes an expert in that field so really recommend reading that article on the community well i hope everybody enjoyed the content today thank you a picture and nilima for joining u today and well see you next time thank you thank you everyone,Task Intelligence for ITSM
